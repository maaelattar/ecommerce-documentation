# Search Service - Key Responsibilities and Scope

## 1. Overview

The Search Service provides fast, relevant, and feature-rich search capabilities across the e-commerce platform's product catalog and potentially other content types (e.g., articles, FAQs). It is a critical component for user navigation and product discovery.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

*   **Product Indexing**: Indexes product data from various sources (primarily the Product Service, enriched with data from Inventory, Pricing, and Reviews services via events) to create a searchable product index.
*   **Query Processing**: Accepts user search queries via its API, processes them, and returns relevant search results.
*   **Faceted Search (Filtering)**: Allows users to refine search results based on various attributes (e.g., category, brand, price range, size, color, ratings).
*   **Sorting**: Enables sorting of search results by relevance, price, rating, newness, etc.
*   **Autosuggestions & Typeahead**: Provides suggestions as the user types in the search bar (e.g., matching product names, categories, brands).
*   **Spell Check & Typo Tolerance**: Handles misspellings and typos in user queries to provide relevant results.
*   **Synonym Management**: Supports synonym lists (e.g., "sofa" = "couch") to broaden search results.
*   **Relevance Tuning**: Implements and allows tuning of relevance ranking algorithms to ensure the most relevant products appear first.
*   **Personalization (Future)**: Potentially incorporates user behavior (past searches, purchases, views) to personalize search results.
*   **Analytics & Reporting**: Provides data or integrates with analytics systems to track search query performance, popular terms, click-through rates, and conversion rates from search.
*   **Index Management**: Handles creation, updates, and maintenance of search indexes, including re-indexing strategies.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1. In Scope

*   Maintaining a search index (e.g., using Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, or a similar technology).
*   Consuming events from other services (Product, Inventory, Pricing, etc.) to keep the search index up-to-date in near real-time.
*   Exposing a public-facing API for search queries, faceting, sorting, and suggestions.
*   Defining and managing the schema of the search index.
*   Implementing query parsing, tokenization, stemming, and other text analysis techniques.
*   Managing search configurations (e.g., weights for different fields, synonym lists, stop words).
*   Providing capabilities for A/B testing different search relevance algorithms or configurations (potentially).
*   Basic security for its API (e.g., rate limiting, protection against malicious queries).

### 3.2. Out of Scope

*   **Primary Data Storage for Products**: The Search Service is not the system of record for product information. The Product Service holds the master product data.
*   **User Interface (UI) for Search**: The Search Service provides an API. The actual search bar, results page, and filter UI are part of the frontend application(s).
*   **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: These functionalities are handled by other services.
*   **User Authentication & Profile Management**: Handled by the User Service.
*   **Content Management for non-product content (e.g., blog posts, marketing pages)**: While the Search Service *could* be extended to index such content, the initial scope is typically product search. If other content types are included, the source and update mechanisms for that content need to be defined.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) / Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Search Latency**: Time taken to return search results (e.g., p95 < 200ms).
*   **Search Relevance**: Measured by click-through rates (CTR) on search results, conversion rates from search, and user satisfaction.
*   **Index Freshness**: Time taken for updates in source systems (e.g., new product) to be reflected in search results (e.g., < 5 minutes).
*   **Scalability**: Ability to handle high query volumes and large product catalogs.
*   **Availability**: High availability to ensure search functionality is always accessible.
*   **Fault Tolerance**: Resilience to failures in dependent services or its own nodes.

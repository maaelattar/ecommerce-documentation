# Search Service Event Handling Overview

This section details how the Search Service handles events originating from other microservices within the e-commerce platform. The primary goal of event handling in the Search Service is to keep its search indexes up-to-date with the latest changes in products, categories, content, and other searchable entities.

## Key Aspects of Event Handling

1.  **Event Consumption**: How the Search Service subscribes to and consumes events from message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
    *   Detailed in `01-event-consumption-mechanism.md`.

2.  **Subscribed Events**: A list of specific events the Search Service is interested in from various source services.
    *   Product-related events detailed in `02-product-events.md`.
    *   Category-related events detailed in `03-category-events.md`.
    *   Content-related events detailed in `04-content-events.md`.
    *   (Potentially others like User Profile events if they influence search, e.g., `05-user-events.md`)

3.  **Event Processing and Transformation**: How raw events are processed, validated, and transformed into a format suitable for updating search indexes.
    *   Detailed in `06-event-processing-and-transformation.md`.

4.  **Index Update Logic**: The strategies for applying changes to the Elasticsearch indexes based on processed events (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting documents).
    *   Detailed in `07-index-update-logic.md`.

5.  **Error Handling and Resilience**: Mechanisms for handling errors during event consumption or processing, including retries, dead-letter queues (DLQs), and idempotency.
    *   Detailed in `08-error-handling-and-resilience.md`.

6.  **Idempotency**: Ensuring that processing the same event multiple times does not have unintended side effects on the search indexes.
    *   Covered within `08-error-handling-and-resilience.md` and `07-index-update-logic.md`.

7.  **Monitoring and Logging**: How event handling processes are monitored for health, performance, and errors.
    *   Detailed in `09-monitoring-and-logging.md`.

8.  **Data Consistency**: Strategies to ensure eventual consistency between the source-of-truth services and the search indexes.
    *   Discussed in `10-data-consistency-strategies.md`.

## Technology Stack

*   **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka (or RabbitMQ, AWS SQS/SNS, etc. - to be consistent with overall architecture).
*   **Event Consumers**: Implemented within the Search Service (NestJS application) using appropriate Kafka client libraries (e.g., `kafkajs`) or NestJS microservice transporters.
*   **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for indexing and searching.

Each linked markdown file will provide detailed specifications for the respective aspect of event handling, including data structures, code examples (TypeScript/NestJS), and operational considerations.

# User Events for Search Service (Conceptual)

## Overview

In some e-commerce scenarios, user-related events can be relevant to the Search Service, primarily for:

1.  **Personalization**: Tailoring search results or suggestions based on user preferences, history, or segment.
2.  **Access Control / Entitlements**: If different users or user groups have access to different product catalogs or content (e.g., B2B scenarios, regional restrictions, membership tiers).
3.  **User-Specific Data in Search**: Indexing user-generated content that should be searchable by that user (e.g., saved searches, wishlists if they were to be made searchable).

This document outlines *potential* user events the Search Service might subscribe to if such features are in scope. The necessity of these events depends heavily on the specific personalization and access control requirements of the platform.

## Potential Subscribed User Events

### 1. `UserProfileUpdated`

*   **Source Service**: User Service / Profile Service
*   **Topic**: `user.events` or `profile.events`
*   **Trigger**: A user updates their profile information relevant to search (e.g., location, preferences, segment).
*   **Payload Structure (Example JSON)**:
    ```json
    {
      "eventId": "uuid-user-profile-updated-1",
      "eventType": "UserProfileUpdated",
      "timestamp": "2023-11-20T10:00:00Z",
      "version": "1.0",
      "source": "UserService",
      "data": {
        "userId": "user_abc123",
        "updatedFields": {
          "preferredCategories": ["cat_electronics", "cat_books"],
          "location": {
            "city": "San Francisco",
            "country": "US"
          },
          "userSegment": "tech_enthusiast", // For personalized ranking or filtering
          "notificationPreferences": { // Less likely for search, but example of profile data
            "emailOptIn": true
          }
        },
        "lastLoginAt": "2023-11-20T09:55:00Z"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Search Service Action**:
    *   If the Search Service maintains user preference profiles for personalization, update the local user profile store.
    *   This might not directly update main search indexes but could influence query construction or result boosting for this specific user during their search sessions.

### 2. `UserSegmentChanged`

*   **Source Service**: User Service / Marketing Automation Service
*   **Topic**: `user.events` or `segmentation.events`
*   **Trigger**: A user is assigned to a new segment or removed from one, which might affect their view or search experience.
*   **Payload Structure (Example JSON)**:
    ```json
    {
      "eventId": "uuid-user-segment-changed-2",
      "eventType": "UserSegmentChanged",
      "timestamp": "2023-11-20T11:00:00Z",
      "version": "1.0",
      "source": "MarketingAutomationService",
      "data": {
        "userId": "user_xyz789",
        "newSegmentId": "vip_customer_tier1",
        "oldSegmentId": "standard_customer",
        "reason": "HighPurchaseVolume"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Search Service Action**:
    *   Update internal user data that might be used to adjust search query parameters (e.g., applying specific filters for VIPs, boosting certain products).
    *   Could trigger a re-evaluation of cached personalized results for the user if any.

### 3. `UserAccountStatusChanged` (e.g., for B2B access)

*   **Source Service**: User Service / B2B Account Management
*   **Topic**: `user.events` or `account.events`
*   **Trigger**: A user's account status changes, potentially affecting their access to specific catalogs or pricing.
*   **Payload Structure (Example JSON)**:
    ```json
    {
      "eventId": "uuid-user-account-status-3",
      "eventType": "UserAccountStatusChanged",
      "timestamp": "2023-11-20T12:00:00Z",
      "version": "1.0",
      "source": "B2BAccountService",
      "data": {
        "userId": "user_b2b_agent_007",
        "companyId": "comp_mega_corp",
        "newStatus": "active_catalog_A", // e.g., active_catalog_A, suspended, pending_approval
        "oldStatus": "pending_approval",
        "accessibleCatalogs": ["catalog_A_premium", "catalog_standard_parts"]
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Search Service Action**:
    *   If search results are filtered based on user entitlements (e.g., different product catalogs for B2B clients), this event is crucial.
    *   The Search Service would need to ensure its query-time filtering logic correctly uses this updated status/entitlement information.
    *   It might involve updating a user permission cache within the Search Service.

## General Considerations for User Events

*   **Scope**: Implementing user event handling for search significantly increases complexity. It should only be undertaken if strong personalization or entitlement requirements justify it.
*   **Data Storage**: The Search Service might need to maintain its own cache or lightweight store of user preferences/segments if this data is frequently accessed during search operations to avoid high-latency calls to the User Service.
*   **Privacy**: Handling user data requires strict adherence to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Ensure that any user data used for search personalization is handled with consent and appropriate security.
*   **Real-time vs. Batch**: Some user data changes might be processed in near real-time (e.g., segment changes impacting immediate search results), while others could be part of a less frequent batch update to personalization models.

## Search Service Responsibilities (If Implemented)

*   Subscribe to relevant `user.events` topics.
*   Process user events to update internal caches or data stores used for personalization or access control.
*   Modify search query execution or result ranking based on user-specific data.
*   Ensure data privacy and security.

**Conclusion**: While powerful, integrating user events directly into search service logic for personalization is an advanced feature. The initial focus for event handling would typically be on core data entities like products, categories, and content. User-related event handling can be a subsequent enhancement based on business priorities.

# Security Operations for Search Service

## Overview

Security Operations (SecOps) for the Search Service involve the ongoing processes, practices, and tools required to protect the service, its data, and its interactions in a production environment. This builds upon the foundational security measures outlined in `../06-integration-points/03-security-integration.md` and focuses on the day-to-day operational aspects of maintaining a secure posture.

## 1. Access Control Management

*   **Credentials for Dependencies**: 
    *   **Elasticsearch**: Securely manage and rotate credentials (API keys, username/passwords) used by the Search Service application to connect to Elasticsearch. Store these in a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets).
    *   **Kafka**: If Kafka requires authentication (e.g., SASL), manage the Search Service consumer's credentials securely.
    *   **Other Services/Databases**: Any other credentials (e.g., for a Redis used for idempotency tracking, or source databases for batch jobs) must be managed with similar rigor.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Regularly review and ensure that the service accounts and roles used by the Search Service application (for accessing Elasticsearch, Kafka, etc.) have only the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Human Access to Elasticsearch/Kafka**: Control direct human access to the Elasticsearch cluster and Kafka brokers. Use defined roles and require strong authentication (MFA if possible) for administrators. Avoid shared accounts.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Access**: Secure access to the CI/CD system. Ensure that credentials used by the pipeline to deploy the Search Service or manage infrastructure are restricted and rotated.

## 2. Vulnerability Management

*   **Regular Scanning**: 
    *   **Container Images**: Continuously scan Docker images for known vulnerabilities in OS packages and application dependencies (e.g., using Trivy, Clair, AWS ECR scanning, Snyk).
    *   **Application Dependencies**: Regularly scan Node.js/NestJS dependencies for vulnerabilities (`npm audit`, Snyk).
    *   **Infrastructure**: If self-managing Elasticsearch or Kafka, scan the underlying VMs/nodes for OS vulnerabilities.
*   **Patch Management**: 
    *   Establish a process for timely patching of identified vulnerabilities in the application, its dependencies, the base Docker image, and underlying infrastructure (OS, Elasticsearch, Kafka versions).
    *   Prioritize patching based on vulnerability severity (e.g., CVSS score).
*   **Stay Informed**: Monitor security bulletins for Elasticsearch, Kafka, Node.js, NestJS, and other key technologies used.

## 3. Monitoring and Threat Detection (Security Focus)

*   **Audit Logs**: 
    *   **Elasticsearch Audit Logs**: Enable and regularly review Elasticsearch audit logs for suspicious activity, unauthorized access attempts, or significant administrative changes.
    *   **Application Logs**: Search Service application logs should record security-relevant events (e.g., authentication failures for admin APIs, significant configuration changes if done via API).
    *   **Kafka Audit Logs (if available/configured)**: Monitor access to Kafka topics and administrative actions.
    *   **Infrastructure Audit Logs (Cloud Provider)**: Monitor cloud provider logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor) for changes to network configurations, security groups, IAM roles related to the Search Service infrastructure.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: If deployed at the network level, monitor alerts from these systems.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralize security-related logs (audit logs, application security logs, IDS/IPS logs) into a SIEM for correlation, analysis, and alerting on suspicious patterns.
*   **Alerting for Security Events**: Configure alerts for:
    *   Repeated authentication failures (to Search Service admin APIs, Elasticsearch, Kafka).
    *   Unauthorized access attempts.
    *   Critical vulnerabilities detected.
    *   Unexpected changes in Elasticsearch security configurations or user permissions.
    *   High rate of 401/403 errors on sensitive APIs.

## 4. Incident Response Plan

*   **Define a Plan**: Have a documented incident response plan that includes steps for handling security breaches, data exposures, or critical vulnerabilities related to the Search Service.
*   **Key Elements**: 
    *   **Identification**: How security incidents are detected and reported.
    *   **Containment**: Steps to isolate affected systems and prevent further damage (e.g., revoking credentials, blocking network access).
    *   **Eradication**: Removing the threat and addressing the root cause (e.g., patching vulnerability, fixing misconfiguration).
    *   **Recovery**: Restoring service securely, potentially from backups.
    *   **Lessons Learned (Post-Mortem)**: Analyze the incident to improve security measures and response procedures.
*   **Communication**: Clear communication channels for reporting incidents and coordinating response efforts.
*   **Team Roles**: Define roles and responsibilities during a security incident.

## 5. Secure Development Practices (Operational Reinforcement)

*   **Input Validation**: Re-emphasize rigorous input validation for all API endpoints and event handlers to prevent common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 relevant aspects like injection, XSS if search results render user content directly, etc.).
*   **Output Encoding**: If search results include user-generated content or data from external sources, ensure proper output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities when rendered by clients.
*   **Dependency Review**: Before adding new dependencies, vet them for security and maintenance track record.
*   **Secrets Management in Code**: Never hardcode secrets. Always use environment variables or a secrets management system.
*   **Code Reviews for Security**: Include security considerations in code reviews.

## 6. Configuration Hardening

*   **Elasticsearch**: Follow Elasticsearch security best practices (disable unused features, secure scripting if used, restrict network access, apply security patches).
*   **Kafka**: Secure Kafka brokers (authentication, authorization, network segmentation, TLS).
*   **Operating System**: Harden the OS of any self-managed nodes (VMs, Kubernetes nodes).
*   **Kubernetes**: Follow Kubernetes security best practices (RBAC, PodSecurityPolicies/PodSecurityAdmission, network policies, secure etcd).

## 7. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing

*   Periodically conduct internal security audits of the Search Service and its dependencies.
*   Engage third-party penetration testers to identify vulnerabilities from an external perspective.
*   Address findings from audits and penetration tests promptly.

Security operations are an ongoing effort, requiring continuous vigilance, adaptation to new threats, and a proactive approach to identify and mitigate risks. Integrating security into the entire lifecycle of the Search Service, from development to deployment and operations (DevSecOps), is key.

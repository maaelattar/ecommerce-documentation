# Deployment Environment and Orchestration

## Overview

This document describes the target deployment environment, containerization strategy, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Search Service application. The reliability and scalability of the Search Service depend heavily on these foundational aspects.

## Target Deployment Environment

*   **Primary Choice**: Kubernetes (K8s)
    *   **Rationale**: Kubernetes is a de-facto standard for orchestrating containerized microservices, offering scalability, resilience, service discovery, and configuration management. It aligns well with a cloud-native microservices architecture.
*   **Alternatives (if K8s is not the platform standard)**:
    *   AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate or EC2.
    *   Google Cloud Run or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) - GKE is a K8s distribution.
    *   Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instances.
    *   Serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) might be suitable for parts of the event consumption or very specific, stateless API endpoints, but generally, a continuously running service is better for managing connections to Kafka and Elasticsearch for the main application.

## Containerization

*   **Technology**: Docker
*   **Dockerfile**: The Search Service application (NestJS/Node.js) will be containerized using a Dockerfile.

    **Example `Dockerfile` (Multi-stage build for Node.js/NestJS):**
    ```dockerfile
    # ---- Base Stage ----
    FROM node:18-alpine AS base
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    # ---- Dependencies Stage ----
    FROM base AS dependencies
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force
    # If you have devDependencies needed for build (e.g., TypeScript), use a separate stage or adjust npm ci

    # ---- Build Stage (if using TypeScript) ----
    FROM base AS build
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm ci # Install all dependencies including devDependencies for build
    COPY . .
    RUN npm run build # Assuming a build script like "tsc -p tsconfig.build.json" in package.json

    # ---- Production Stage ----
    FROM base AS production
    ENV NODE_ENV=production
    # Copy production node_modules from dependencies stage
    COPY --from=dependencies /usr/src/app/node_modules ./node_modules
    # Copy compiled application from build stage (e.g., dist folder)
    COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/dist ./dist
    # Copy package.json (optional, but good practice)
    COPY package.json . 

    # Health check (optional, can also be configured in K8s)
    # HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=15s --retries=3 \
    #   CMD [ "node", "dist/main.js", "healthcheck" ] # Assuming a healthcheck command

    EXPOSE 3000 # Or whatever port the application listens on, configurable via ENV var
    CMD [ "node", "dist/main.js" ]
    ```

*   **Container Registry**: Docker images will be stored in a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry (GCR), Azure Container Registry (ACR), Harbor).

## CI/CD Pipeline

A robust CI/CD pipeline is essential for automated testing, building, and deploying the Search Service.

*   **Source Code Management**: Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
*   **CI/CD Platform**: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps.

### CI (Continuous Integration) Stages:

1.  **Trigger**: Code push to a repository (main branch or feature branches).
2.  **Checkout Code**: Clone the repository.
3.  **Setup Environment**: Configure Node.js version.
4.  **Install Dependencies**: `npm ci`.
5.  **Linting**: Run code linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
6.  **Unit Tests**: Execute unit tests (e.g., Jest for NestJS). Code coverage checks.
7.  **Integration Tests (Optional in CI, often separate)**: Run integration tests that might require dependencies like a local Elasticsearch or Kafka instance (can use Docker Compose for this in CI environment).
8.  **Security Scans**: Perform vulnerability scanning on code and dependencies (e.g., Snyk, npm audit, trivy for container images).
9.  **Build Application**: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript (`npm run build`).
10. **Build Docker Image**: Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
11. **Push Docker Image**: Push the tagged image to the container registry.
12. **Publish Artifacts (Optional)**: Store test reports, coverage reports.

### CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery) Stages:

1.  **Trigger**: Successful CI build on a specific branch (e.g., main/master for staging, tags for production) or manual approval.
2.  **Fetch Docker Image**: Pull the newly built image from the container registry.
3.  **Environment Configuration**: Apply environment-specific configurations (e.g., Kubernetes ConfigMaps, Secrets, environment variables) for the target environment (staging, production).
    *   These configurations would include Kafka brokers, Elasticsearch node addresses, database credentials (if any), log levels, etc.
4.  **Deployment to Staging**: Deploy the application to a staging environment.
    *   **Kubernetes**: `kubectl apply -f deployment-staging.yaml` or using tools like Helm, Kustomize, Argo CD.
    *   Run automated smoke tests or integration tests against the staging deployment.
5.  **Approval (Optional)**: Manual approval gate before production deployment.
6.  **Deployment to Production**: Deploy to the production environment.
    *   **Strategies**: Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling Update (Kubernetes default). Choose based on risk tolerance and desired uptime.
    *   **Kubernetes**: Update the image tag in the Kubernetes `Deployment` object.
7.  **Post-Deployment Verification**: Run smoke tests in production. Monitor key metrics immediately after deployment.
8.  **Rollback Plan**: Have a clear, automated (or semi-automated) process to roll back to the previous stable version if the new deployment fails or causes issues.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*   Define Kubernetes manifests (`Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`, etc.) or other infrastructure resources (e.g., for ECS, using Terraform or CloudFormation) as code.
*   Store this IaC in version control and manage it through the CI/CD pipeline.

## Key Considerations

*   **Security in CI/CD**: Securely manage secrets (API keys, registry credentials) used in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using Jenkins Credentials, GitHub Secrets, Vault).
*   **Build Optimization**: Optimize Docker image build times (e.g., layer caching, multi-stage builds).
*   **Testing Strategy**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage at different levels (unit, integration, E2E - though E2E is often separate from application CI/CD).
*   **Pipeline Speed**: Aim for a fast and reliable CI/CD pipeline to enable quick iterations.

By establishing a solid deployment environment, containerization strategy, and CI/CD pipeline, the Search Service can be deployed and updated frequently, reliably, and with minimal manual intervention.

# Search Service Deployment and Operations Overview

This section details the deployment strategies, operational procedures, and infrastructure considerations for the Search Service and its primary dependency, Elasticsearch.

## Key Topics

1.  **Deployment Environment & Orchestration**:
    *   Target environment (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS).
    *   Containerization (Docker).
    *   CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying the Search Service application.
    *   Detailed in `01-deployment-environment.md`.

2.  **Elasticsearch Cluster Management**:
    *   Deployment options for Elasticsearch (self-managed vs. managed service like AWS OpenSearch/Elastic Cloud).
    *   Cluster sizing, sharding, and replication strategy.
    *   Backups and disaster recovery for Elasticsearch data.
    *   Upgrades and maintenance of the Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   Detailed in `02-elasticsearch-cluster-management.md`.

3.  **Search Service Application Deployment**:
    *   Configuration management for different environments.
    *   Scaling strategies (horizontal scaling of service instances).
    *   Zero-downtime deployments (e.g., blue-green, canary).
    *   Detailed in `03-application-deployment.md`.

4.  **Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting (Operational Focus)**:
    *   Recap of key operational metrics for both the Search Service application and Elasticsearch.
    *   Integration with centralized monitoring and logging systems.
    *   Alerting rules for critical issues (e.g., high error rates, Elasticsearch cluster health, high consumer lag).
    *   This builds upon `../05-event-handling/09-monitoring-and-logging.md` with a specific operational deployment lens.
    *   Detailed in `04-operational-monitoring-alerting.md`.

5.  **Indexing Operations and Management**:
    *   Managing Elasticsearch index templates and mappings.
    *   Strategies for re-indexing (full and partial) with minimal impact (e.g., using aliases).
    *   Managing batch ingestion jobs (scheduling, monitoring, error handling for operational jobs).
    *   Capacity planning for index growth.
    *   Detailed in `05-indexing-operations.md`.

6.  **Performance Tuning and Optimization**:
    *   Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks in the Search Service application and Elasticsearch queries.
    *   Elasticsearch query optimization techniques.
    *   Caching strategies (as also covered in `../03-core-components/08-cache-management.md` but from an operational perspective).
    *   Detailed in `06-performance-tuning.md`.

7.  **Backup and Disaster Recovery (Application & Configuration)**:
    *   Backup strategy for Search Service configurations (if not fully managed by environment variables or a config service).
    *   Disaster recovery plan for the Search Service application itself (relying on stateless design and quick redeployment).
    *   Note: Elasticsearch data backup/DR is covered in `02-elasticsearch-cluster-management.md`.
    *   Detailed in `07-application-backup-dr.md`.

8.  **Security Operations**:
    *   Managing access credentials for Elasticsearch, Kafka, and other dependencies.
    *   Auditing access and administrative actions.
    *   Responding to security incidents.
    *   Regular review of security configurations.
    *   Builds upon `../06-integration-points/03-security-integration.md` with an operational focus.
    *   Detailed in `08-security-operations.md`.

Each document will provide practical guidance and considerations for running the Search Service reliably and efficiently in a production environment.

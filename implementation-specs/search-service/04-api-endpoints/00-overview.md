# Search Service API Endpoints Overview

This section outlines the API endpoints provided by the Search Service. These endpoints allow clients to perform search queries, get suggestions, and manage search-related configurations.

## Key API Endpoints

The Search Service will expose RESTful APIs for the following functionalities:

1.  **Product Search API** (`/search/products`):
    *   Allows searching for products based on various criteria like keywords, categories, attributes, price ranges, etc.
    *   Supports pagination, sorting, and filtering.
    *   Detailed in `01-product-search-api.md`.

2.  **Category Search API** (`/search/categories`):
    *   Enables searching or browsing product categories.
    *   Can be used to retrieve category trees or filter categories based on names or other properties.
    *   Detailed in `02-category-search-api.md`.

3.  **Content Search API** (`/search/content`):
    *   Provides search capabilities for unstructured content like articles, blog posts, or help pages.
    *   Supports full-text search and filtering based on metadata.
    *   Detailed in `03-content-search-api.md`.

4.  **Autocomplete/Suggestions API** (`/search/suggest`):
    *   Offers real-time suggestions and autocompletion as users type in search queries.
    *   Can provide suggestions for products, categories, or keywords.
    *   Detailed in `04-autocomplete-api.md`.

5.  **Indexing Management API** (`/admin/search/indexing`):
    *   Administrative endpoints for managing the search index.
    *   Includes operations like triggering re-indexing, checking indexing status, and managing index aliases.
    *   This API is intended for internal use or by administrative tools and requires appropriate authentication and authorization.
    *   Detailed in `05-indexing-management-api.md`.

## Design Principles

*   **RESTful Architecture**: APIs will adhere to REST principles, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
*   **Statelessness**: Each request from a client will contain all the information needed to service the request.
*   **Standardized Error Handling**: Consistent error response formats will be used across all endpoints.
*   **Versioning**: API versioning will be implemented (e.g., via URL path `/v1/...`) to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.
*   **Security**: Endpoints will be secured using appropriate authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API Keys) and authorization mechanisms. Public search APIs might have different security considerations than administrative APIs.
*   **Performance**: APIs will be designed for low latency and high throughput, leveraging caching and optimized query execution.

## OpenAPI Specification

An OpenAPI (Swagger) specification will be provided for all public-facing endpoints, detailing request/response schemas, parameters, and authentication methods. This specification will be available at `/api-docs`.

Each linked markdown file will provide detailed specifications for the respective API endpoint(s), including:
*   Endpoint URL and HTTP method.
*   Request parameters (path, query, body).
*   Request and response schemas (JSON).
*   Sample requests and responses.
*   Error codes and messages.
*   Security considerations specific to the endpoint.

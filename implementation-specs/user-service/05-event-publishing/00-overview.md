# Event Publishing - Overview

This section details the event publishing strategy for the User Service. As critical user-related actions occur, the User Service will publish domain events to a message broker. These events allow other microservices in the e-commerce platform to react to changes in user data, authentication status, and other relevant occurrences in a decoupled manner.

We will document the following key aspects of event publishing:

1.  **Event Publishing Mechanism**:
    *   The chosen message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SNS/SQS).
    *   How the User Service integrates with the broker (e.g., NestJS microservice client, specific SDKs).
    *   Event serialization format (e.g., JSON, Avro).

2.  **Key Published Events**:
    *   Detailed schemas and example payloads for each significant event. Events will be grouped by the domain aggregate or context they relate to.
    *   Examples include:
        *   User Account Events (`UserRegistered`, `UserEmailVerified`, `UserPasswordChanged`, `UserAccountStatusChanged`, `UserDeleted`).
        *   User Profile Events (`UserProfileUpdated`, `UserAddressAdded`, `UserAddressUpdated`, `UserAddressDeleted`).
        *   Authentication Events (`UserLoggedIn`, `UserLoginFailed`, `UserLoggedOut`, `MfaStatusChanged`).
        *   Role & Permission Events (Admin context) (`RoleCreated`, `RoleAssignedToUser`, `PermissionGrantedToRole`).

3.  **Event Naming Conventions and Topics/Exchanges**:
    *   Standardized naming for events (e.g., `UserRegisteredEventV1`).
    *   Structure of topics (for Kafka) or exchanges/routing keys (for RabbitMQ) used for publishing user events.

4.  **Event Payloads and Data Minimization**:
    *   Guidance on what data to include in event payloads â€“ enough for consumers to act, but avoiding excessive or sensitive PII unless necessary and secured.
    *   Consideration of "fat events" vs. "thin events" (and callbacks).

5.  **Idempotency Considerations for Publishers (and Consumers)**:
    *   Brief mention of ensuring events are published reliably, and how consumers should ideally handle potential duplicates (though consumer idempotency is primarily a consumer-side concern).

6.  **Error Handling in Publishing**:
    *   Strategies for dealing with failures during event publication (e.g., retries, dead-letter queues for undeliverable events from the publisher side).

7.  **Schema Management and Versioning**:
    *   How event schemas are defined, managed, and versioned to allow for evolution without breaking consumers (e.g., schema registry, version numbers in event names/payloads).

8.  **Security of Published Events**:
    *   Considerations for securing event topics/queues.
    *   Encryption of sensitive event payloads in transit (via broker security) and potentially at rest if stored.

Each significant event or group of events, along with the general mechanisms, will be detailed in subsequent markdown files within this section.

# User Service: Data Model & Persistence Overview

## 1. Introduction

This section details the data model for the User Service, outlining the key entities it manages, their attributes, and their relationships. It also discusses the choice of database technology and the strategy for managing database schema evolution.

A well-defined data model is crucial for ensuring data integrity, consistency, and for supporting the User Service's core functionalities related to user accounts, profiles, authentication, and authorization.

## 2. Key Data Entities

The User Service primarily manages the following data entities:

*   **User (`User`)**: The central entity representing an individual with an account on the platform.
    *   Detailed in `01-user-entity.md`.
*   **User Profile (`UserProfile`)**: Contains extended information about a user, such as personal details, contact information, and preferences.
    *   Detailed in `02-user-profile-entity.md`.
*   **Address (`Address`)**: Represents physical addresses associated with a user (e.g., shipping, billing).
    *   Detailed in `03-address-entity.md`.
*   **Role (`Role`)**: Defines a set of permissions or a named role within the system (e.g., "customer", "administrator").
    *   Detailed in `04-role-entity.md`.
*   **Permission (`Permission`)**: Represents a granular permission or capability within the system (e.g., "view_product", "manage_users").
    *   Detailed in `05-permission-entity.md`.
*   **Role-Permission Link (`RolePermissionLink`)**: An associative entity that links roles to their granted permissions.
    *   Detailed in `06-role-permission-link-entity.md`.
*   **(User-Role Link)**: The `User` entity will typically have a direct or indirect relationship to the `Role` entity to signify which roles a user possesses.

## 3. Relationships

*   A `User` typically has one `UserProfile` (One-to-One).
*   A `User` can have multiple `Address`es (One-to-Many).
*   A `User` can have multiple `Role`s (Many-to-Many, often through a join table or an array of role IDs/names on the User entity if roles are relatively static per user).
*   A `Role` can have multiple `Permission`s (Many-to-Many, typically managed via `RolePermissionLink`).

## 4. Database Technology

*   The choice of database and rationale will be discussed in `07-database-selection.md`.
*   Considerations include relational vs. NoSQL, data consistency requirements, scalability, and team familiarity.

## 5. ORM/ODM and Migrations

*   The strategy for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) or Object-Document Mapping (ODM) and database schema migrations will be detailed in `08-orm-migrations.md`.
*   This ensures that changes to the data model can be applied to the database schema in a controlled and versioned manner.

## 6. Data Privacy and Security Considerations

*   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: The User Service manages significant PII (email, name, addresses, phone numbers). The data model and persistence layer must be designed with security and privacy as top priorities.
*   **Password Storage**: Passwords must never be stored in plaintext. They must be securely hashed using strong, modern algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). This is primarily a concern for the `User` entity and will be detailed in its schema and related service components.
*   **Data Encryption**: Consider encryption at rest for sensitive fields or the entire database, and always use encryption in transit (TLS/SSL).

Each subsequent document in this section will provide the detailed schema, attributes, constraints, and considerations for the respective entities.

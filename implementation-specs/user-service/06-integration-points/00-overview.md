# Integration Points - Overview

This section details the various integration points of the User Service with other microservices within the e-commerce platform and potentially with external systems. These integrations are crucial for a cohesive and functional user experience and for enabling other services to perform their duties based on user data and identity.

Integrations can be categorized into several types:

1.  **API Consumption by Clients/Gateways**:
    *   How frontend applications (web, mobile) and API gateways interact with the User Service's exposed REST/GraphQL APIs for authentication, user management, and profile operations.

2.  **Event Consumption by Other Microservices**:
    *   Other services subscribing to events published by the User Service (e.g., `UserRegisteredEvent`, `UserProfileUpdatedEvent`) to keep their own data synchronized or to trigger workflows.

3.  **Service-to-Service API Calls (User Service as a Consumer)**:
    *   Instances where the User Service might need to call other microservices (e.g., calling a Notification Service to send emails, though often this is done via events).

4.  **Service-to-Service API Calls (User Service as a Provider)**:
    *   Other microservices directly querying the User Service's APIs for specific information not available through events or JWTs (e.g., an Order Service fetching detailed address information for a user if not embedded in an order creation request).

5.  **Authentication and Authorization Integration**:
    *   How other services verify JWTs issued by the User Service.
    *   Integration with API gateways for centralized authentication enforcement.
    *   How RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) data (roles, permissions) managed by the User Service is consumed or utilized by other services or gateways to enforce authorization.

6.  **Integration with Shared Platform Services**:
    *   Interaction with services like:
        *   **Logging Service**: For sending structured logs.
        *   **Monitoring/Alerting Service**: For publishing metrics and health checks.
        *   **Configuration Service**: For fetching dynamic configurations.
        *   **Service Discovery**: Registering with and discovering other services (e.g., via Kubernetes DNS, Consul).

7.  **External System Integrations (if any)**:
    *   Connections to third-party identity providers (IdPs) for social logins (OAuth/OIDC).
    *   Integration with services like "Have I Been Pwned" for breached password checks.
    *   Connections to external communication services (e.g., email providers like SendGrid, Twilio for SMS) if not routed through an internal Notification Service.

8.  **Database Integration**:
    *   The User Service's own database for persisting user, profile, role, and permission data.
    *   (Rarely) Direct read access to User Service data by other highly trusted internal services (generally an anti-pattern, prefer APIs or events).

9.  **Security Service Integration**:
    *   Sending audit logs or security-relevant events to a centralized security information and event management (SIEM) system or a dedicated Security Service.
    *   Receiving threat intelligence or directives from a Security Service.

Each significant integration point or pattern will be detailed in its own markdown file, outlining the purpose, mechanism, data exchanged, and any security or performance considerations.

# User Service: Overview and Purpose

## 1. Introduction

The User Service is a foundational microservice within the e-commerce platform. It acts as the central authority for managing all aspects of user identity, authentication, authorization, and user profile data. Its primary goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and scalable solution for handling user accounts and ensuring that other services can correctly identify and authorize users.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

The User Service is responsible for:

*   **User Account Management**: 
    *   Handling user registration (account creation).
    *   Managing account status (e.g., active, suspended, pending verification).
    *   Securely storing and managing user credentials (password hashing).
    *   Facilitating password reset and recovery processes.
    *   Handling email verification processes.
*   **Authentication**: 
    *   Verifying user credentials upon login.
    *   Issuing authentication tokens (e.g., JSON Web Tokens - JWTs) or managing sessions to confirm user identity for subsequent requests to the platform.
    *   Managing token lifecycles, including refresh tokens and potentially token revocation.
*   **User Profile Management**:
    *   Storing and managing user profile information, such as names, contact details (phone numbers), shipping and billing addresses, and user preferences.
    *   Providing APIs for users to view and update their own profile information.
*   **Authorization Data Management**:
    *   Managing user roles (e.g., `customer`, `administrator`, `support_agent`, `content_manager`).
    *   Managing granular permissions that define what actions a role can perform.
    *   Storing the association between users and their roles.
    *   Providing mechanisms or data for other services to query or determine a user's permissions (though the enforcement often happens at the resource service or API Gateway level, based on information from the User Service).
*   **Third-Party Authentication (Optional)**:
    *   Integrating with external identity providers (IdPs) like Google, Facebook, or other OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect compliant systems to allow users to sign up or log in using their existing accounts.
*   **Event Publishing**: 
    *   Emitting events when significant user-related actions occur (e.g., `UserCreated`, `UserProfileUpdated`, `UserRoleChanged`) so other interested microservices can react accordingly.

## 3. Key Functionalities

To fulfill its responsibilities, the User Service offers the following key functionalities:

*   **User Registration**: Allowing new users to create an account.
*   **User Login/Logout**: Authenticating users and managing their session state.
*   **Password Management**: Securely hashing passwords, and providing mechanisms for users to change and reset their passwords.
*   **Email Verification**: Ensuring users provide a valid email address that they control.
*   **Profile CRUD**: Allowing users (and potentially administrators) to create, read, update, and delete profile information (including addresses).
*   **Role and Permission Management**: APIs for administrators to define roles, assign permissions to roles, and assign roles to users.
*   **Token Issuance and Validation Support**: Generating and providing mechanisms for validating authentication tokens (JWTs).
*   **User Data Retrieval**: Providing APIs for other services to fetch necessary user information (with appropriate authorization).

## 4. Non-Goals (What the User Service Does NOT Do)

*   **Manage Product Catalogs, Orders, Inventory, etc.**: These are handled by their respective dedicated microservices.
*   **Implement Business Logic Unrelated to User Identity**: The User Service focuses solely on user identity and access management.
*   **Store Highly Sensitive Financial Data**: While it might store billing addresses, actual payment instrument details are typically handled by a dedicated, PCI-compliant Payment Service.
*   **Act as a Full-Fledged API Gateway**: While it provides authentication, it doesn't typically handle request routing, rate limiting for all services, or broad API composition â€“ these are API Gateway responsibilities.

## 5. Importance in the Architecture

The User Service is a critical component:

*   **Security Keystone**: It underpins the security of the entire platform by managing who can access what.
*   **Centralized User Data**: Provides a single source of truth for user identity and profile information, reducing data duplication and inconsistency.
*   **Enables Personalization**: By managing user profiles and preferences, it provides data that can be used by other services to personalize user experiences.
*   **Facilitates Other Services**: Many other services (Orders, Payments, Reviews, etc.) depend on the User Service to identify and authenticate the acting user.

Failure or compromise of the User Service can have severe consequences for the entire e-commerce platform, highlighting the need for robust security, reliability, and scalability in its design and implementation.

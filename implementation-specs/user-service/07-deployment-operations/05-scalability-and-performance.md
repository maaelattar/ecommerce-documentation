# 05: Scalability and Performance

The User Service must be designed and deployed to handle varying loads efficiently and maintain high performance standards. This document outlines strategies for achieving scalability and optimal performance.

## 1. Horizontal Scaling (Application Tier)

*   **Mechanism**: The primary method for scaling the stateless User Service application tier is horizontal scaling, which involves running multiple instances (pods in Kubernetes) of the service.
*   **Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)**:
    *   HPA will be configured to automatically adjust the number of User Service pods based on observed metrics.
    *   **Metrics for Scaling**: Primarily CPU utilization. Custom metrics (e.g., requests per second per pod, Kafka consumer lag if the service is a heavy consumer) can also be considered if CPU is not the most direct indicator of load.
    *   **Configuration**: Define `minReplicas`, `maxReplicas`, and `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage` (or target values for custom metrics).
    *   **Example HPA Manifest (Conceptual)**:
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
        kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
        metadata:
          name: user-service-hpa
        spec:
          scaleTargetRef:
            apiVersion: apps/v1
            kind: Deployment
            name: user-service-deployment
          minReplicas: 2  # Ensure at least 2 replicas for high availability
          maxReplicas: 10 # Define an upper limit
          metrics:
          - type: Resource
            resource:
              name: cpu
              target:
                type: Utilization
                averageUtilization: 70 # Target 70% CPU utilization
          # - type: Pods # Example for custom metric (if exposed by Prometheus adapter)
          #   pods:
          #     metric:
          #       name: http_requests_per_second
          #     target:
          #       type: AverageValue
          #       averageValue: 100 # Target 100 RPS per pod
        ```
*   **Statelessness**: The User Service is designed to be stateless, meaning any instance can handle any request. This is crucial for effective horizontal scaling. Session state, if any (though JWTs are preferred), should be managed externally (e.g., Redis, but JWTs avoid this need for user sessions).

## 2. Database Scaling Strategies

*   **Read Replicas**: Utilize read replicas for the PostgreSQL database to offload read-heavy traffic from the primary write instance. The User Service application code should be capable of directing read-only queries to these replicas.
    *   Managed database services (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) make creating and managing read replicas straightforward.
*   **Vertical Scaling (Primary Instance)**: If the primary database instance becomes a bottleneck for writes, it can be vertically scaled (i.e., increased in size/capacity - CPU, RAM, IOPS).
*   **Connection Pooling**: Efficiently manage database connections from the User Service instances using a connection pool (e.g., TypeORM's built-in pooling, or external poolers like PgBouncer if needed at a larger scale).
*   **Query Optimization**: Regularly review and optimize database queries. Use indexes appropriately. Monitor slow queries.
*   **Sharding (Future Consideration)**: For extremely high write loads or very large datasets, database sharding might be considered in the long term. This adds significant complexity and would be a major architectural change.

## 3. Kafka Consumer Group Scaling

*   **Parallelism**: If the User Service consumes events from Kafka (e.g., for inter-service communication or reacting to other domain events), the number of consumers in a consumer group can be scaled up to the number of partitions in the topic. This allows for parallel processing of messages.
*   **Rebalancing**: Kafka handles consumer group rebalancing automatically when consumers are added or removed. Ensure the service handles rebalances gracefully (e.g., commits offsets properly).
*   **Processing Logic**: Ensure message processing logic is efficient to avoid becoming a bottleneck and increasing consumer lag.

## 4. Caching Strategies

While the User Service itself might not be heavily reliant on caching for its primary data (as user data needs to be consistent), certain aspects can benefit from caching:

*   **JWT Public Keys (JWKS)**: If using asymmetric JWTs, the public keys (JWKS URI) used for token verification can be cached by the service (and API Gateway) for a short period to reduce frequent fetching.
*   **Role/Permission Data**: If roles and permissions data is relatively static and frequently accessed for authorization checks, it could be cached within the service instance with an appropriate TTL (Time-To-Live) or an event-based invalidation mechanism when changes occur (e.g., listen to `RoleUpdated`, `PermissionUpdated` events).
    *   Consider using an in-memory cache (like `cache-manager` in NestJS) for this or a distributed cache like Redis if data needs to be shared across all instances and staleness is a concern.
*   **External Service Responses**: Responses from infrequently changing external services (e.g., HIBP for a compromised password check during registration, if allowed to be cached) could be cached to reduce latency and load on the external system.
*   **Configuration Data**: As discussed in `03-configuration-management.md`, some configurations might be fetched and cached.

**Note**: Aggressively caching user-specific data that changes frequently can lead to stale data issues. Prioritize caching for data that is read-heavy and changes infrequently.

## 5. Performance Testing and Benchmarks

*   **Regular Testing**: Conduct regular performance and load testing to understand the service's behavior under stress and identify bottlenecks.
    *   **Tools**: k6, JMeter, Locust, Artillery.
*   **Test Scenarios**: Simulate realistic user traffic patterns, including:
    *   High number of concurrent users.
    *   Peak load scenarios (e.g., during promotions).
    *   Specific API endpoint stress tests (e.g., login, registration, profile updates).
*   **Baseline Benchmarks**: Establish baseline performance benchmarks for key APIs.
*   **Environment**: Performance testing should ideally be conducted in a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible in terms of resources and configuration.
*   **Identify Bottlenecks**: Analyze test results to identify bottlenecks in the application code, database, Kafka, or other dependencies.
*   **Capacity Planning**: Use performance test results to inform capacity planning and HPA configuration.

## 6. Code and Dependency Optimization

*   **Efficient Algorithms**: Ensure critical code paths use efficient algorithms and data structures.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: Leverage asynchronous operations (e.g., `async/await` in Node.js/TypeScript) to prevent blocking I/O operations from impacting throughput.
*   **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date and regularly review them for performance implications or known vulnerabilities.
*   **Payload Sizes**: Minimize API request/response payload sizes. Use techniques like pagination and field selection where appropriate.

By implementing these strategies, the User Service can scale effectively to meet demand and deliver a responsive user experience.

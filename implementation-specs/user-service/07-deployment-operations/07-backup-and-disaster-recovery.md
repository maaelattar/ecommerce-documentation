# 07: Backup and Disaster Recovery (DR)

A robust backup and disaster recovery plan is crucial for the User Service to ensure data durability and service availability in the event of system failures, data corruption, or larger-scale disasters.

## 1. Database Backup (PostgreSQL)

*   **Managed Service Features**: Leveraging a managed PostgreSQL service (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) is highly recommended as they provide mature backup and recovery capabilities.
*   **Automated Backups**:
    *   **Frequency**: Daily automated snapshots of the database.
    *   **Retention Policy**: Define a retention period for automated backups (e.g., 7 to 30 days, based on RPO and compliance requirements).
*   **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**:
    *   Enable PITR to allow restoration to any specific second within the backup retention window (typically up to the last 5 minutes from the current time).
    *   This relies on continuous archiving of Write-Ahead Logs (WALs).
*   **Manual Snapshots**: Take manual snapshots before major changes (e.g., significant schema migrations, application upgrades) for additional safety.
*   **Cross-Region/Cross-Account Backups (for DR)**: For enhanced disaster recovery, consider replicating snapshots to a different geographic region or a separate cloud account.
*   **Testing Restores**: Regularly test the database restore process (e.g., quarterly) to ensure backups are valid and the restore procedure works as expected. Test restoring to a specific point in time.

## 2. Kafka Data Backup/Replication (for DR)

While Kafka's inherent replication (across brokers in different AZs) provides high availability, it does not protect against logical corruption, accidental topic deletion, or full cluster/region failure.

*   **Topic Replication Factor**: Ensure all critical topics (like `user.events`) have a replication factor of at least 3, spread across multiple Availability Zones. This is for HA, not DR per se.
*   **Managed Service DR Features**: Some managed Kafka services (e.g., Confluent Replicator, Amazon MSK features) offer tools or capabilities for cross-cluster or cross-region replication of topic data.
*   **MirrorMaker 2 (for self-managed or if applicable)**: Apache Kafka's MirrorMaker 2 tool can be used to replicate data between Kafka clusters, potentially in different data centers or regions.
*   **Log Compaction (for specific topics)**: For topics where only the latest value for a key is important (e.g., user profile snapshots if event sourcing isn't the sole source of truth), log compaction can reduce storage but is not a backup strategy itself.
*   **Considerations for User Events**: For `user.events`, the primary concern is ensuring consumers have processed them. If events are critical for rebuilding state in other services, consider:
    *   Longer retention periods on Kafka itself if storage allows.
    *   Ensuring downstream services store the data they need persistently after consumption.
    *   Archiving events to a cheaper, long-term storage (e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage) from Kafka if a permanent audit trail or replay capability beyond Kafka's retention is needed. This is more archiving than active DR for Kafka itself.
*   **RPO/RTO for Kafka Data**: Define the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for Kafka event data. If RPO is very low, active-active or active-passive replication to a DR cluster is needed.

## 3. Application State & Configuration Backup

*   **Stateless Application**: The User Service application itself is designed to be stateless. Application state is primarily in the database and Kafka.
*   **Container Images**: Docker images are stored in a container registry (e.g., ECR, GCR, Docker Hub). Ensure the registry itself is resilient and images are versioned.
*   **Kubernetes Manifests & Configurations**: Store all Kubernetes deployment YAMLs, Helm charts, and ConfigMap/Secret definitions in a version control system (e.g., Git) following GitOps principles.
    *   This allows for quick redeployment of the application and its configuration to any cluster.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**: Backup the configuration of the CI/CD pipeline.

## 4. Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan

*   **DR Scenarios**: Define potential DR scenarios (e.g., single AZ failure, full regional outage, major data corruption).
*   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum acceptable data loss. This will influence backup frequency and replication strategies.
    *   Example: RPO for user database < 15 minutes.
*   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Maximum acceptable downtime for the service to be restored.
    *   Example: RTO for User Service < 2 hours for regional outage.
*   **DR Site/Region**: Designate a DR region.
*   **Failover Procedures**: Document step-by-step procedures for failing over to the DR region.
    *   **Database Failover**: Promote a read replica in the DR region or restore from a cross-region snapshot.
    *   **Kafka Failover**: Switch producers and consumers to a replica Kafka cluster in the DR region (if one exists and is synchronized).
    *   **Application Deployment**: Deploy User Service instances in the DR region Kubernetes cluster using manifests from Git.
    *   **DNS Failover**: Update DNS records to point API traffic to the load balancers in the DR region.
*   **Dependencies**: Consider DR plans for all critical dependencies of the User Service (e.g., API Gateway, Notification Service, external authentication providers if their DR impacts User Service).
*   **Regular DR Drills**: Conduct DR drills (e.g., annually or bi-annually) to test the plan, identify gaps, and ensure the team is familiar with the procedures. This can range from tabletop exercises to full failover tests.
*   **Communication Plan**: Part of the DR plan should include how to communicate status to internal stakeholders and, if necessary, customers.

## 5. Data Corruption Handling

*   **Immutable Events**: The event-driven nature (e.g., `user.events`) means events are immutable, which can help in understanding history but doesn't prevent publishing bad data.
*   **Database PITR**: Point-in-Time Recovery for the database is crucial for recovering from logical data corruption (e.g., accidental mass deletion, bad data update).
*   **Compensating Transactions**: For event-sourced systems, if bad events are published, compensating events may need to be issued to correct the state.
*   **Manual Intervention**: Some corruption scenarios might require manual data fixes after restoring to a clean state or by targeted scripts.

By implementing comprehensive backup strategies and a well-tested DR plan, the User Service can achieve high levels of data durability and service resilience, minimizing the impact of potential disasters.

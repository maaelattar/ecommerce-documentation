# 06: Security Operations

Security is an ongoing operational concern for the User Service, which handles sensitive user data. This document outlines key security operations (SecOps) practices to protect the service and its data in production.

## 1. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing

*   **Internal Audits**: Conduct regular internal security reviews of the User Service codebase, configurations, and infrastructure.
    *   Focus on adherence to security best practices, secure coding guidelines, and internal security policies.
*   **External Penetration Testing**: Engage third-party security professionals to perform penetration tests on the User Service and its APIs at least annually, or after significant changes.
    *   Identify vulnerabilities that internal teams might overlook.
*   **Scope**: Testing should cover API endpoints, authentication/authorization mechanisms, data validation, dependency vulnerabilities, and infrastructure security.
*   **Remediation**: Establish a process for tracking and remediating identified vulnerabilities based on their severity.

## 2. Vulnerability Scanning

*   **Container Image Scanning**: Integrate automated security scanning of Docker images into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Tools**: Trivy, Clair, Aqua Security, Snyk, or cloud provider tools (e.g., AWS ECR scanning, Google Container Analysis).
    *   Scan for known vulnerabilities in OS packages and application dependencies.
    *   Fail builds or block deployments if high-severity vulnerabilities are found.
*   **Dependency Scanning (Application Code)**:
    *   Use tools like `npm audit`, Snyk, Dependabot (GitHub), or OWASP Dependency-Check to scan application dependencies (e.g., Node.js packages) for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Integrate into CI/CD and regularly review findings.
*   **Infrastructure Scanning**: Regularly scan infrastructure components (e.g., Kubernetes nodes, database instances if self-managed) for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

## 3. Incident Response Plan

*   **Develop a Plan**: Have a documented incident response plan specifically for security incidents related to the User Service (and generally for the platform).
*   **Key Plan Components**:
    *   **Preparation**: Tools, training, roles, and responsibilities.
    *   **Identification**: How security incidents are detected (monitoring, alerts, user reports).
    *   **Containment**: Steps to limit the impact of an incident (e.g., isolating affected systems, blocking malicious IPs).
    *   **Eradication**: Removing the cause of the incident (e.g., patching vulnerabilities, removing malware).
    *   **Recovery**: Restoring affected systems and services safely.
    *   **Lessons Learned (Post-Mortem)**: Analyze the incident to improve security posture and response capabilities.
*   **Communication**: Clear communication channels and protocols for internal teams and, if necessary, external stakeholders (users, regulatory bodies) in case of a breach.
*   **Practice**: Conduct periodic incident response drills or tabletop exercises.

## 4. Access Control and IAM for Infrastructure

*   **Least Privilege**: Enforce the principle of least privilege for all access to infrastructure components (Kubernetes API, cloud provider console/APIs, database, Kafka).
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    *   Use Kubernetes RBAC to control access to cluster resources.
    *   Use cloud provider IAM (Identity and Access Management) to control access to cloud resources.
    *   Define roles with specific permissions tailored to job functions (e.g., developer, SRE, security admin).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Mandate MFA for all administrative access to cloud provider consoles, Kubernetes clusters, and other critical systems.
*   **Audit Logs**: Ensure audit logging is enabled for all administrative actions on infrastructure components. Regularly review these logs for suspicious activity.
*   **No Shared Credentials**: Avoid shared accounts or API keys. Each user or service should have unique credentials.
*   **Secrets Management**: Infrastructure-level secrets (e.g., Kubeconfig files with admin access, cloud provider access keys for CI/CD) must be securely managed and tightly controlled.

## 5. Data Encryption (Operational Focus)

While data encryption is covered in other sections (e.g., database, event security), this section reiterates its operational importance:

*   **Encryption at Rest**:
    *   **Database**: Ensure managed database services are configured for encryption at rest (e.g., AWS RDS encryption using KMS).
    *   **Kafka**: Ensure data stored on Kafka brokers (topic data) is encrypted at rest if supported by the managed service or configured for self-managed clusters.
    *   **Container Image Registry**: Ensure images stored in registries are encrypted at rest.
    *   **Backup Encryption**: Ensure all backups (database, application data) are encrypted.
*   **Encryption in Transit**:
    *   **HTTPS**: All API communication (clients to User Service, service-to-service) must use TLS/HTTPS.
    *   **Database Connections**: Use TLS to encrypt connections between the User Service and the PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Kafka Connections**: Use TLS (and potentially SASL) to encrypt connections between the User Service and Kafka brokers.
    *   **Internal Kubernetes Traffic**: Consider a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for mTLS between pods if east-west traffic encryption is a strong requirement within the cluster.
*   **Key Management**: Securely manage encryption keys, preferably using a dedicated Key Management Service (KMS) like AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault.
    *   Regularly rotate keys where appropriate and feasible.

## 6. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

*   **Log Forwarding**: Forward relevant security logs from the User Service, Kubernetes, database, Kafka, and other infrastructure components to a central SIEM system.
*   **Correlation and Analysis**: The SIEM can correlate events from multiple sources to detect sophisticated attacks or anomalous behavior.
*   **Alerting**: Configure SIEM to generate alerts for critical security events.

By implementing these security operations practices, the risk of security breaches can be significantly reduced, and the ability to respond effectively to incidents can be enhanced, safeguarding user data and maintaining trust in the platform.

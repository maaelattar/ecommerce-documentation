# 00: Deployment and Operations - Overview

This section details the deployment strategies, operational considerations, and maintenance practices for the User Service.

## Topics Covered:

1.  **[01-deployment-strategy.md](./01-deployment-strategy.md)**:
    *   Containerization (Docker)
    *   Orchestration (Kubernetes)
    *   Deployment environments (Development, Staging, Production)
    *   CI/CD pipeline integration
    *   Blue/Green or Canary deployment options

2.  **[02-infrastructure-requirements.md](./02-infrastructure-requirements.md)**:
    *   Compute resources (CPU, Memory)
    *   Database (PostgreSQL - sizing, replication, backups)
    *   Message Broker (Kafka - cluster setup, topics, partitions, replication)
    *   Networking (VPC, subnets, load balancers, firewalls)
    *   Secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

3.  **[03-configuration-management.md](./03-configuration-management.md)**:
    *   Environment variables
    *   Configuration files
    *   Centralized configuration service integration
    *   Dynamic configuration updates

4.  **[04-monitoring-and-alerting.md](./04-monitoring-and-alerting.md)**:
    *   Key metrics to monitor (latency, error rates, resource utilization, Kafka lag)
    *   Logging strategy (structured logging, log aggregation - ELK/EFK stack)
    *   Alerting thresholds and notification channels
    *   Distributed tracing integration
    *   Health check endpoints

5.  **[05-scalability-and-performance.md](./05-scalability-and-performance.md)**:
    *   Horizontal scaling (Kubernetes HPA)
    *   Database scaling strategies
    *   Kafka consumer group scaling
    *   Caching strategies (if applicable beyond token caching)
    *   Performance testing and benchmarks

6.  **[06-security-operations.md](./06-security-operations.md)**:
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing
    *   Vulnerability scanning (container images, dependencies)
    *   Incident response plan
    *   Access control and IAM for infrastructure
    *   Data encryption at rest and in transit (reiteration from other sections, focusing on infra)

7.  **[07-backup-and-disaster-recovery.md](./07-backup-and-disaster-recovery.md)**:
    *   Database backup schedule and retention policy
    *   Kafka data backup/replication for DR
    *   Disaster recovery plan (RPO/RTO objectives)
    *   Failover procedures

8.  **[08-maintenance-and-upgrades.md](./08-maintenance-and-upgrades.md)**:
    *   Patch management for OS and dependencies
    *   Application upgrade process (rolling updates)
    *   Database schema migration management (coordinated with app deployment)
    *   Zero-downtime deployment goals

This overview provides a roadmap for ensuring the User Service is deployed robustly, operates reliably, and can be maintained effectively.

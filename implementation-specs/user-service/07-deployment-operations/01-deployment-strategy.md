# 01: Deployment Strategy

The User Service will be deployed as a containerized application, orchestrated by Kubernetes. This approach ensures consistency across environments, scalability, and resilience.

## 1. Containerization

*   **Technology**: Docker
*   **Base Image**: A lean, secure, and up-to-date official Node.js image (e.g., `node:18-alpine` or `node:20-slim`) will be used as the base for the User Service container.
*   **Dockerfile Best Practices**:
    *   Multi-stage builds to keep the final image size small and reduce attack surface (e.g., separate build stage for compiling TypeScript and installing dev dependencies).
    *   Run as a non-root user for enhanced security.
    *   Minimize the number of layers by combining `RUN` commands where logical.
    *   Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist` from the host during build context).
    *   Clearly define `EXPOSE` for the service port (e.g., `3000`).
    *   Implement health checks (`HEALTHCHECK` instruction) within the Dockerfile.

### Example Dockerfile Snippet (Conceptual)

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --only=production --ignore-scripts --prefer-offline
COPY . .
RUN npm run build # Assuming a build script compiles TS to JS in 'dist'

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/dist ./dist
COPY package.json . # Or only necessary parts

# Best practice: Create a non-root user
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup
USER appuser

EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "node", "dist/main.js" ]

# Basic health check (customize as needed)
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget --quiet --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:3000/api/health/status || exit 1
```

## 2. Orchestration

*   **Technology**: Kubernetes (K8s)
*   **Manifests**: Standard Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret, HorizontalPodAutoscaler, Ingress) will be defined, likely using YAML or a templating engine like Helm for better manageability and parameterization across environments.
*   **Deployment Object**: Manages stateless instances of the User Service, enabling declarative updates and rollbacks.
*   **Service Object**: Provides a stable internal IP address and DNS name for the User Service, enabling service discovery. A LoadBalancer type service or an Ingress controller will be used for external exposure.
*   **HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)**: Automatically scales the number of User Service pods based on CPU utilization or custom metrics.

## 3. Deployment Environments

Standard environments will be maintained:

*   **Development (Dev)**: For local development and initial testing. May run locally via Docker Compose or on a shared dev Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Staging (Stag)**: A production-like environment for UAT, integration testing, and performance testing. Deployed with near-production configurations.
*   **Production (Prod)**: The live environment serving end-users. Highest level of monitoring, security, and availability.

Configuration differences between environments will be managed via Kubernetes ConfigMaps, Secrets, and environment variables injected into the containers.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

*   **Tools**: GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or a similar platform.
*   **Pipeline Stages (Typical)**:
    1.  **Checkout**: Fetch the latest code.
    2.  **Lint & Static Analysis**: Check code quality and potential issues.
    3.  **Unit & Integration Tests**: Run automated tests. Coverage reports generated.
    4.  **Build Docker Image**: Build and tag the User Service Docker image.
    5.  **Push to Registry**: Push the image to a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Docker Hub, GitLab Registry).
    6.  **Security Scan**: Scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities.
    7.  **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy the new image to the staging environment.
    8.  **Automated Staging Tests**: Run smoke tests or E2E tests on staging.
    9.  **Manual Approval (Optional)**: Gate before production deployment.
    10. **Deploy to Production**: Deploy to the production environment (potentially using Blue/Green or Canary).
    11. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**: Observe initial performance and error rates.

## 5. Advanced Deployment Options

To minimize downtime and risk during production updates, the following strategies will be considered:

*   **Blue/Green Deployment**:
    *   Maintain two identical production environments: Blue (current live) and Green (new version).
    *   Deploy the new version to the Green environment.
    *   After testing Green, switch traffic from Blue to Green.
    *   Keep Blue available for quick rollback if issues arise in Green.
    *   Requires careful management of database schema changes and stateful components.

*   **Canary Deployment**:
    *   Release the new version to a small subset of users/traffic.
    *   Monitor performance and user feedback closely.
    *   Gradually roll out the new version to the entire user base if no issues are detected.
    *   Allows for early detection of problems and limits the blast radius of potential bugs.
    *   Often managed using Kubernetes Ingress controllers or service mesh capabilities (e.g., Istio, Linkerd).

The choice between Blue/Green and Canary (or a hybrid approach) will depend on the specific risk tolerance, complexity of changes, and the capabilities of the chosen CI/CD and orchestration tools.

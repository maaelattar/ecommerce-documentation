# 04: Database and Common Setup Helpers (Future Considerations)

## 1. Introduction

This document discusses potential future additions to the `testing-utils` library, specifically focusing on utilities for database testing and common test setup/teardown procedures. The development of these utilities will depend on identifying truly common patterns and needs across multiple microservices to avoid creating overly specific or heavy components.

## 2. Database Testing Utilities

As many microservices will interact with databases (e.g., PostgreSQL with TypeORM), shared utilities could potentially simplify database-related testing.

### 2.1. Potential Scope

*   **Test Database Management:**
    *   Helpers for setting up and tearing down test databases for integration tests.
    *   This could involve utilities for managing schema (e.g., running migrations), clearing data between tests, and connecting to test instances.
    *   Consideration for tools like `testcontainers` to spin up ephemeral database instances (e.g., PostgreSQL in Docker) for more isolated testing.
    *   Alternatively, for simpler unit tests or when TypeORM is used, helpers for configuring and using in-memory databases like SQLite.
*   **Entity Factories:**
    *   Functions to easily create and persist mock entity data with randomized or predefined values, useful for populating the database for specific test scenarios.
    *   Could integrate with libraries like `factory.ts` or `@faker-js/faker`.
*   **Mock Repository Implementations (Less Likely for a Shared Library):**
    *   While services often mock their TypeORM repositories for unit tests, providing generic mock repository implementations in a shared library can be challenging due to the highly specific nature of each entity and its methods. It's often better for services to mock their own repositories as needed.

### 2.2. Key Considerations

*   **Database Diversity:** If services might use different database technologies in the future, a shared library must be careful not to become too tightly coupled to one (e.g., PostgreSQL).
*   **Complexity:** Database testing setup can be complex. Utilities should genuinely simplify this without introducing too much abstraction or magic.
*   **ORM Specificity:** If utilities are ORM-specific (e.g., for TypeORM), this should be clearly defined.

## 3. Common Test Setup/Teardown Utilities

As services develop, common patterns for setting up NestJS testing modules might emerge.

### 3.1. Potential Scope

*   **Test Module Builders:**
    *   Functions that simplify the creation of `Test.createTestingModule(...)` by pre-configuring commonly mocked providers (e.g., `MockLoggerService`, `MockConfigService`, `MockRabbitMQProducerService`, `MockJwtAuthGuard` from `testing-utils` itself).
    *   Example: `createStandardTestingModule({ controllers: [...], providers: [...] })` that automatically includes all standard mocks.
*   **Global Test Setup:**
    *   Utilities for global test environment setup if needed (though Jest and NestJS provide much of this).

### 3.2. Key Considerations

*   **Over-Generalization:** Avoid creating setup utilities that are too generic to be useful or too specific to a small subset of services.
*   **Maintainability:** Ensure these helpers are easy to understand and maintain.

## 4. Current Status

*   **Not Implemented:** These database and common setup utilities are not part of the current version of `testing-utils`.
*   **Future Consideration:** Their development will be evaluated based on clear, recurring needs and patterns observed during the development and testing of multiple microservices. The goal is to add value by reducing boilerplate and promoting consistency where it makes sense.

If these features are prioritized, this document will be updated with detailed design and usage specifications.

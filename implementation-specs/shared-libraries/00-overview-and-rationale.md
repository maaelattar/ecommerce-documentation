# 00: Shared Libraries - Overview and Rationale

## 1. Introduction

As the e-commerce platform develops using a microservices architecture, several common functionalities and cross-cutting concerns will emerge across multiple services. To promote code reuse, consistency, and development efficiency, a set of shared libraries (or packages) will be developed and maintained.

These libraries will encapsulate common logic, utility functions, and standardized approaches to tasks that are not specific to any single service's business domain.

This documentation section will detail the design, contents, and usage guidelines for these shared libraries.

## 2. Rationale and Benefits

Adopting shared libraries offers several advantages:

*   **Code Reusability:** Avoids duplication of common code across multiple microservices, saving development time and effort.
*   **Consistency:** Enforces standard ways of handling common tasks like logging, error handling, configuration, and event structures, leading to a more uniform and predictable system.
*   **Maintainability:** Centralizes common logic. Bug fixes or improvements to shared functionalities only need to be made in one place and then propagated by updating the library version in consuming services.
*   **Accelerated Development:** Provides pre-built, tested components that service developers can leverage, speeding up the development of new services and features.
*   **Best Practice Enforcement:** Shared libraries can codify architectural decisions and best practices (e.g., standardized error formats, security primitives).
*   **Simplified Onboarding:** New developers can get up to speed faster by learning common patterns from the shared libraries.

## 3. Scope of Shared Libraries

Potential areas to be covered by shared libraries include, but are not limited to:

*   **Core Utilities:**
    *   Common data structures or helper functions.
    *   String manipulation, date/time utilities, etc.
*   **Logging:**
    *   Standardized logger configuration (e.g., for Winston or Pino in a Node.js/NestJS context).
    *   Common log formats and context propagation.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Standardized error classes and DTOs.
    *   Middleware or interceptors for consistent error response formatting.
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   Utilities for loading and validating environment-specific configurations (e.g., wrappers around `@nestjs/config`).
*   **Event Handling (Kafka):**
    *   Common event envelope/schema.
    *   Utility functions for producing and consuming Kafka events (e.g., serializers, deserializers, dead-letter queue handling helpers).
*   **API Client Utilities (Internal Services):**
    *   Typed clients or wrappers for easier communication between internal microservices.
*   **Authentication & Authorization Utilities:**
    *   Decorators or guards for NestJS that integrate with the User Service for token validation and permission checks (though core auth logic remains in User Service).
*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) / Interfaces:**
    *   Common DTOs or TypeScript interfaces that are shared across service boundaries (e.g., a standard `UserContext` object, common pagination structures).
*   **Database Utilities (if applicable):**
    *   Common base entities or repository patterns if a consistent data access layer is desired beyond what TypeORM provides out-of-the-box.

## 4. Key Considerations

*   **Versioning:** Shared libraries must be strictly versioned (e.g., using Semantic Versioning - SemVer).
*   **Distribution:** A private package registry (e.g., private NPM registry, GitHub Packages, Artifactory) will be used to host and distribute these libraries.
*   **Dependency Management:** Services will declare dependencies on specific versions of these shared libraries.
*   **Coupling vs. Reusability:** Care must be taken to ensure shared libraries promote reusability without introducing tight coupling that hinders service independence. Libraries should be focused and have clear boundaries.
*   **Testing:** Shared libraries must have high test coverage (unit tests, integration tests where applicable).
*   **Governance:** A clear process for proposing, developing, reviewing, and releasing changes to shared libraries will be necessary.

## 5. Structure of this Documentation

Subsequent documents in this section will detail individual shared libraries or logical groupings of shared functionalities, covering:

*   Purpose and scope of the specific library/module.
*   API documentation.
*   Usage examples.
*   Versioning and contribution guidelines.

This initiative aligns with ADR-003 (Node.js/NestJS for Initial Services) which recommended developing common libraries for cross-cutting concerns.

# 09: Event Security Considerations

Securing events published by the Payment Service is paramount, given the sensitive nature of payment-related data. This document outlines key security considerations for event publishing via RabbitMQ.

## 1. Transport Layer Security (TLS)

*   **RabbitMQ Connections:** All connections from the Payment Service's `RabbitMQProducerService` to the RabbitMQ broker (Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ) MUST use TLS (Transport Layer Security, also known as SSL).
*   **Shared Library Responsibility:** The `@ecommerce-platform/rabbitmq-event-utils` library should ensure that its `RabbitMQProducerModule` and `RabbitMQConsumerModule` (if also part of it) are configured to establish TLS-encrypted connections by default when appropriate connection parameters (e.g., port 5671 for AMQPS, enabling SSL/TLS flags) are provided through the `SharedConfigModule`.
*   **Purpose:** Encrypts event data in transit between the Payment Service and the RabbitMQ broker, protecting it from eavesdropping.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization for Publishing

*   **Broker Authentication:** The Payment Service (via `RabbitMQProducerService`) MUST authenticate with the RabbitMQ broker using strong credentials (username and password). These credentials should be managed securely, for example, through AWS Secrets Manager, and accessed via the `SharedConfigModule`.
*   **Broker Authorization:** The RabbitMQ user configured for the Payment Service should have restricted permissions:
    *   **Write Access:** Only to the specific exchanges it needs to publish to (e.g., `payment.events`).
    *   **No Read Access (Typically):** The publisher identity generally does not need read access to queues, unless it has a specific, justified need (e.g., for certain admin tasks or complex routing validation, which is rare for a standard publisher).
    *   **No Configure Access (Typically):** The publisher should not have permissions to create/delete exchanges, queues, or alter broker topology unless explicitly required for its operational setup (which should be managed by deployment scripts or admin tools, not the running application).
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions for publishing events.

## 3. Data Minimization in Payloads

*   As detailed in `06-event-payloads-data-minimization.md`, event payloads MUST NOT contain raw sensitive data like full PANs, CVCs, or complete bank account numbers.
*   Use tokenized representations or non-sensitive identifiers.
*   This is a critical security measure to limit the impact if an event is inadvertently accessed by an unauthorized party or if a consumer has a security vulnerability.

## 4. Input Validation (Indirectly Related to Publishing Security)

*   While not directly part of event publishing security, the data that *forms* the event payload originates from inputs to the Payment Service's APIs or internal processes.
*   Robust input validation at the service boundary (API endpoints) is crucial to prevent malicious or malformed data from entering the system and subsequently being published in events. This helps protect consumers from malformed event payloads.## 5. Secure Handling of the Outbox Table

*   **Database Security:** The `outbox` table itself resides within the Payment Service's database and is protected by standard database security measures (access controls, encryption at rest if configured for the DB).
*   **Relay Process Security:** The relay process that reads from the outbox and publishes to RabbitMQ must also run with appropriate permissions and secure configuration.

## 6. Consumer-Side Security (Beyond Publisher's Direct Control but Important Context)

*   **Authentication/Authorization for Consumers:** Services consuming events from RabbitMQ queues bound to the `payment.events` exchange must also authenticate with RabbitMQ and be authorized only to read from their specific queues.
*   **Secure Processing by Consumers:** Consumers are responsible for securely processing the event data they receive.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Both publishing and consuming services must undergo regular security assessments and patch management.

## 7. Auditing and Logging

*   **Publishing Logs:** The `RabbitMQProducerService` should log key details about publishing attempts, successes, and failures (including `eventId`, `eventType`, `exchange`, `routingKey`, and error messages). These logs should be sent to a centralized logging system.
*   **RabbitMQ Audit Logs:** Leverage any audit logging capabilities provided by Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ to track administrative actions and significant broker events.
*   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor logs for suspicious activity, such as repeated publishing failures from unexpected sources or unauthorized connection attempts to RabbitMQ.

By implementing these security measures, the Payment Service can mitigate risks associated with publishing events and help maintain the overall security posture of the e-commerce platform.

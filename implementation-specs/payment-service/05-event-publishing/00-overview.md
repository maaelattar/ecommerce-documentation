# 00: Overview of Event Publishing in Payment Service

## Purpose

This section details the event publishing strategy for the Payment Service. The primary goal is to reliably communicate significant state changes related to payments, refunds, and payment methods to other interested microservices within the e-commerce platform. This enables decoupled workflows, data synchronization, and real-time updates across the system.

## Eventing Mechanism: RabbitMQ

The Payment Service utilizes **RabbitMQ** (via Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ) as its primary message broker for publishing events. This choice aligns with the platform's overall messaging strategy (refer to ADR-018 and TDAC/03) which prioritizes RabbitMQ for its reliability, flexible routing capabilities, and mature ecosystem.

## Shared Library: `@ecommerce-platform/rabbitmq-event-utils`

To ensure consistency, reliability, and maintainability in event publishing and consumption, the Payment Service leverages the `@ecommerce-platform/rabbitmq-event-utils` shared library. This library provides standardized components for:

*   **Message Envelope:** A consistent structure for all published events, including metadata like event ID, timestamp, source, and version.
*   **Producer Module:** Simplified and standardized way to publish messages to RabbitMQ exchanges.
*   **Configuration:** Centralized and environment-aware configuration for RabbitMQ connections and parameters.

Using this shared library abstracts away the complexities of direct RabbitMQ integration, allowing developers to focus on business logic and event definitions.

## Key Principles

*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Events are published asynchronously, decoupling the Payment Service from its consumers.
*   **Reliability:** Leveraging RabbitMQ's persistence and acknowledgment mechanisms, along with robust error handling in the producer module.
*   **Atomicity (Outbox Pattern):** While not explicitly part of the `rabbitmq-event-utils` library itself, an outbox pattern will be implemented within the Payment Service to ensure that events are published reliably if and only if the originating database transaction commits. This guarantees data consistency between the service's internal state and the events it broadcasts.
*   **Data Minimization:** Event payloads will contain only the necessary information required by consumers, avoiding unnecessary data exposure.
*   **Clear Naming and Versioning:** Events will have clear, consistent names and will be versioned to manage schema evolution.

## Scope of this Section

This section will cover:

*   The core mechanism for event publishing (this document).
*   Definitions of key events related to payments, refunds, and payment methods.
*   Event naming conventions and topic/exchange strategies.
*   Guidance on event payload design and data minimization.
*   Strategies for idempotency and error handling in publishing.
*   Schema management and versioning for events.
*   Security considerations for published events.

By adhering to these principles and leveraging the shared RabbitMQ utilities, the Payment Service will effectively and reliably communicate its state changes to the rest ofthe platform.

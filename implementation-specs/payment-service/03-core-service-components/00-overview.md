# 00: Core Service Components - Overview

This section details the internal architecture of the Payment Service by describing its core components. These components encapsulate specific functionalities and work together to provide the overall payment processing capabilities.

## Key Internal Components:

1.  **`PaymentProcessingService` (`01-payment-processing-service.md`)**: Orchestrates the end-to-end payment flow. It handles requests to initiate payments, interacts with gateway services to process them, and updates the status of `Payment` and `Transaction` entities.

2.  **`PaymentGatewayIntegrationService` (`02-payment-gateway-integration-service.md`)**: An abstract component or a set of specific services (e.g., `StripeIntegrationService`, `PayPalIntegrationService`) responsible for all direct communication with external payment gateways. It handles API calls for creating payment intents, processing charges, managing refunds, and tokenizing payment methods according to each gateway's specific API.

3.  **`TransactionManagementService` (`03-transaction-management-service.md`)**: Manages the lifecycle of `Transaction` entities. It ensures that individual transaction records are created, updated accurately, and reflect the outcomes of gateway operations.

4.  **`RefundService` (`04-refund-service.md`)**: Handles all aspects of refund processing. This includes validating refund requests, interacting with the `PaymentGatewayIntegrationService` to process refunds via the gateway, and updating `Refund` and related `Payment`/`Transaction` entities.

5.  **`PaymentMethodService` (`05-payment-method-service.md`)**: Manages customer payment methods. This includes securely adding new payment methods (tokenizing them via gateways), listing available methods for a user, setting a default method, and handling updates or deletions.

6.  **`WebhookHandlerService` (`06-webhook-handler-service.md`)**: Responsible for receiving, verifying, and processing incoming webhook events from payment gateways. It ensures that these asynchronous updates are correctly applied to the relevant entities (e.g., updating payment status, logging chargebacks).

7.  **`FraudDetectionService` (or Integration Point) (`07-fraud-detection-service.md`)**: Implements logic or integrates with external services to assess the risk of transactions and potentially block or flag suspicious payment attempts. (This might be a thin client if a dedicated external fraud service is used).

8.  **`PaymentEventPublisherService` (`08-payment-event-publisher-service.md`)**: Publishes events (e.g., `PaymentSucceeded`, `PaymentFailed`, `RefundProcessed`) to a message broker like Kafka. These events are consumed by other microservices (e.g., Order Service, Notification Service) to react to payment outcomes.

9.  **`SecurityAndComplianceService` (`09-security-compliance-service.md`)**: A conceptual component that encapsulates security best practices and compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS considerations, data encryption utilities, audit logging hooks). It might not be a single concrete service but rather a set of concerns implemented across other services and through shared libraries or interceptors.

10. **`ConfigurationService` (`10-configuration-service.md`)**: (Leveraging NestJS `@nestjs/config` or similar) Manages access to service configurations, especially sensitive data like API keys for payment gateways, ensuring they are handled securely.

These components form the backbone of the Payment Service, ensuring modularity, separation of concerns, and a clear structure for implementing complex payment logic.

# 01: Deployment Strategy for Payment Service

The deployment strategy for the Payment Service focuses on automation, reliability, and minimizing risk during updates. It leverages containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD best practices.

## 1. Containerization with Docker

*   **Docker Image:** The Payment Service application will be packaged as a Docker image.
    *   The `Dockerfile` will define the environment, copy application code, install dependencies, and specify the startup command.
    *   Use multi-stage builds to create lean production images, excluding build-time dependencies and development tools.
    *   Base images should be official, minimal, and regularly scanned for vulnerabilities (e.g., `node:alpine` or a distroless image).
*   **Image Registry:** Docker images will be stored in a private container registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Google GCR, Azure ACR, Harbor).
    *   Implement image tagging strategies (e.g., semantic versioning, Git commit SHA).

## 2. Orchestration with Kubernetes (K8s)

*   **Kubernetes Manifests:** The Payment Service will be deployed and managed on a Kubernetes cluster using declarative manifest files (YAML).
    *   **Deployment:** Manages ReplicaSets, enabling declarative updates and rollbacks. Defines the desired number of replicas (pods).
    *   **Service:** Provides a stable network endpoint (IP address and DNS name) to access the Payment Service pods. Typically a `ClusterIP` service for internal access, fronted by an Ingress or API Gateway.
    *   **ConfigMaps:** Manage non-sensitive configuration data.
    *   **Secrets:** Manage sensitive configuration data (API keys, database credentials).
    *   **HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA):** Automatically scales the number of pods based on observed CPU utilization or custom metrics.
    *   **PodDisruptionBudgets (PDB):** Ensure a minimum number of pods remain available during voluntary disruptions (e.g., node maintenance).
    *   **Resource Requests and Limits:** Define CPU and memory requests and limits for pods to ensure stable performance and resource allocation.
    *   **Liveness and Readiness Probes:** Configure probes to help Kubernetes manage pod health and traffic routing.
        *   **Readiness Probe:** Indicates if the pod is ready to accept traffic.
        *   **Liveness Probe:** Indicates if the pod is running correctly; if not, K8s will restart it.

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

A robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Deployment) pipeline will automate the build, test, and deployment process.

*   **Source Code Repository:** Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
*   **CI Server:** (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI).
*   **Pipeline Stages:**
    1.  **Commit Stage:** Triggered on code commits to development/feature branches.
        *   Code checkout.
        *   Linting and static code analysis (including SAST).
        *   Unit tests and integration tests.
        *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for dependencies.
    2.  **Build Stage:** Triggered on successful commit stage (e.g., merge to main/release branch).
        *   Build Docker image.
        *   Tag Docker image.
        *   Push Docker image to container registry.
    3.  **Test/Staging Deployment Stage:**
        *   Deploy the new image to a staging/testing Kubernetes environment.
        *   Run automated end-to-end tests, API tests, and potentially DAST scans.
        *   User Acceptance Testing (UAT) might occur here.
    4.  **Production Deployment Stage (Approval Gated):**
        *   Requires manual approval before proceeding to production.
        *   Deploy to production using a chosen deployment pattern (see below).
        *   Smoke tests post-deployment.
        *   Monitor application health and performance closely after deployment.

## 4. Production Deployment Patterns

To minimize downtime and risk during updates in the production environment:

*   **Rolling Updates:**
    *   Default strategy provided by Kubernetes Deployments.
    *   Gradually replaces old pods with new ones, instance by instance.
    *   Ensures zero downtime if new pods are healthy.
    *   Can be configured with `maxSurge` (how many extra pods can be created) and `maxUnavailable` (how many pods can be unavailable).
*   **Blue/Green Deployment:**
    *   Maintain two identical production environments: "Blue" (current live) and "Green" (new version).
    *   Deploy the new version to the Green environment.
    *   Test the Green environment thoroughly.
    *   Switch traffic from Blue to Green (e.g., by updating a load balancer or DNS record).
    *   Easy rollback by switching traffic back to Blue.
    *   Requires more infrastructure resources.
*   **Canary Deployment:**
    *   Release the new version to a small subset of users/traffic.
    *   Monitor performance and error rates for this subset.
    *   If stable, gradually roll out the new version to the rest of the traffic.
    *   If issues arise, roll back the canary release.
    *   More complex to implement, often requires advanced traffic management (e.g., service mesh like Istio, Linkerd, or Ingress controller capabilities).

**Chosen Approach:** Initially, **Rolling Updates** will be the primary method due to its native support in Kubernetes. As the system matures and if requirements demand more sophisticated rollout control or instant rollback capabilities, **Blue/Green** or **Canary** strategies (likely leveraging a service mesh or advanced Ingress controller) will be evaluated and implemented.

## 5. Versioning

*   **API Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/v1/payments`, `/v2/payments`) to allow clients to opt-in to new API versions and avoid breaking changes.
*   **Application Versioning:** Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for the Payment Service application builds and Docker images.

This deployment strategy provides a balance of automation, safety, and agility for the Payment Service.

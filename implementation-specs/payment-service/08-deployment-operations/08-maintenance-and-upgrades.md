# 08: Maintenance and Upgrades for Payment Service

Ongoing maintenance and seamless upgrades are critical for the long-term health, security, and functionality of the Payment Service. This document outlines procedures for patching, application upgrades, schema migrations, and strategies for minimizing downtime.

## 1. Patch Management

Regularly applying patches to the underlying infrastructure and software components is essential for security and stability.

*   **Scope:**
    *   **Operating System (OS):** For Kubernetes worker nodes (if not managed by the cloud provider, or if using custom node images).
    *   **Kubernetes Platform:** Regularly upgrade the Kubernetes version (control plane and worker nodes) provided by the managed service or for self-managed clusters.
    *   **Database System (PostgreSQL):** Apply minor version updates and security patches to the PostgreSQL instances (often handled by managed DB services with scheduled maintenance windows).
    *   **Kafka Cluster:** Apply patches and upgrades to the Kafka brokers.
    *   **Other Infrastructure Components:** Patches for load balancers, API Gateways, monitoring tools, etc.
    *   **Application Dependencies:** Regularly update third-party libraries used by the Payment Service (covered in `07-security-and-compliance/07-vulnerability-management.md` under SCA).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Monitoring:** Stay informed about new patches and security advisories from vendors.
    2.  **Testing:** Test patches in a staging/non-production environment before applying to production.
    3.  **Scheduling:** Plan patching during scheduled maintenance windows to minimize impact.
    4.  **Automation:** Automate patching where possible (e.g., managed K8s services often handle node OS patching).
    5.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a rollback plan in case patches cause unexpected issues.

## 2. Application Upgrades

Deploying new versions of the Payment Service application with new features, bug fixes, or performance improvements.

*   **Deployment Strategy:** Utilize deployment strategies outlined in `08-deployment-operations/01-deployment-strategy.md` (Rolling Updates, Blue/Green, Canary) to achieve zero or minimal downtime.
*   **Versioning:** Follow semantic versioning for application releases.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate the upgrade process through the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Backward Compatibility:**
    *   Strive for backward compatibility in APIs and event schemas, especially for minor and patch releases, to avoid breaking consumers.
    *   If breaking changes are necessary (major release), provide a versioned API and a clear migration path for consumers.
*   **Smoke Testing:** Perform automated smoke tests immediately after an upgrade to verify critical functionalities.
*   **Monitoring:** Closely monitor application performance and error rates after an upgrade.
*   **Rollback:** Ensure a quick and reliable rollback procedure is in place if the new version introduces critical issues.

## 3. Database Schema Migrations

Updating the database schema to support new application features or changes.

*   **Migration Tools:** Use a database migration tool (e.g., TypeORM Migrations, Flyway, Liquibase) to manage and version schema changes.
    *   Migrations should be written as scripts and checked into version control.
*   **Zero-Downtime Migration Principles:**
    *   **Expand/Contract Pattern (Parallel Changes):** For complex changes like renaming a column or changing its type without downtime:
        1.  **Expand:** Add the new column/table. Modify the application to write to both old and new structures, but read from the old. Start backfilling data to the new structure.
        2.  **Migrate/Verify:** Once backfilling is complete, modify the application to read from the new structure. Continue writing to both or switch writes to the new structure.
        3.  **Contract:** Remove the old column/table and the application code that writes to/reads from it.
    *   **Online Schema Change Tools:** Some databases or third-party tools offer online schema change capabilities that minimize locking.
    *   **Avoid Long-Running Transactions:** Schema changes should avoid long-running transactions that can block database operations.
*   **Testing Migrations:** Thoroughly test schema migrations in a staging environment with a production-like data set.
*   **Rollback Strategy for Migrations:** Have a plan for rolling back schema changes if necessary, though this can be complex. It's often better to roll forward with a fix if possible.
*   **Deployment:** Integrate schema migration execution into the CI/CD pipeline, typically run just before the new application version is deployed or as a separate, controlled step.

## 4. Zero-Downtime Deployment (ZDD) Considerations

Achieving true zero-downtime requires a combination of the above strategies:

*   **Stateless Application Design.**
*   **Robust Liveness and Readiness Probes.**
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** Application pods should handle SIGTERM signals gracefully, finishing in-flight requests and releasing resources before shutting down.
*   **Connection Draining:** Load balancers should support connection draining to allow existing connections to complete before a pod is removed from service.
*   **Database Connection Management:** Ensure the application handles database connection drops and retries gracefully during database maintenance or failovers.
*   **Feature Flags:** Use feature flags to decouple deployment from feature release, allowing new code to be deployed but hidden until ready. This can also help in quickly disabling a problematic new feature without a full rollback.

## 5. Communication

*   For planned maintenance or upgrades that might have a very brief impact or require a maintenance window (though aiming to avoid this), communicate clearly and in advance with internal stakeholders and, if necessary, external users.

By implementing these maintenance and upgrade procedures, the Payment Service can evolve securely and reliably with minimal disruption to its critical operations.

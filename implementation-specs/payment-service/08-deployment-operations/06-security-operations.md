# 06: Security Operations for Payment Service

Security Operations (SecOps) for the Payment Service involve the ongoing activities and processes required to protect the service in its production environment, detect threats, and respond to security incidents. This builds upon the foundational security measures defined in the "Security and Compliance" section (`07-security-and-compliance`).

## 1. Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning (Production)

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Continuously scan production systems (container images, hosts if applicable, external-facing endpoints) for known vulnerabilities using automated tools.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic penetration tests specifically targeting the production environment (with appropriate safeguards and coordination) to simulate real-world attacks.
*   **Configuration Audits:** Regularly audit security configurations of Kubernetes, databases, Kafka, firewalls, WAF, and IAM to ensure they adhere to security best practices and haven't drifted from the secure baseline.
*   **Compliance Audits:** Perform audits to ensure ongoing compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and other relevant regulations.

## 2. Incident Response (Operationalization)

*   **IR Plan Activation:** Ensure the Incident Response plan (detailed in `07-security-and-compliance/08-incident-response.md`) is fully operational and the IR team is ready to act.
*   **Security Monitoring and Alert Triage:** Actively monitor security alerts from SIEM, WAF, IDS/IPS, and other security tools. Triage alerts promptly to identify genuine incidents.
*   **Playbook Execution:** Utilize pre-defined incident response playbooks for common payment-related security scenarios.
*   **Forensics Readiness:** Have capabilities and procedures in place for digital forensics if an investigation is required (e.g., preserving logs, taking snapshots).
*   **Communication:** Execute internal and external communication plans during incidents.

## 3. Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Infrastructure & Services

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Strictly enforce the principle of least privilege for all access to production infrastructure (Kubernetes API, cloud provider console, databases, Kafka management interfaces).
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Use RBAC for managing permissions to cloud resources and Kubernetes.
*   **Strong Authentication:** Require strong authentication (MFA where possible) for all administrative access to production systems.
*   **Service Accounts (Kubernetes):** Use dedicated Kubernetes service accounts for applications/pods with minimal necessary permissions, rather than default or overly permissive accounts.
*   **Cloud IAM Roles:** Utilize cloud provider IAM roles for services (e.g., EC2 instance profiles, EKS pod IAM roles) to grant temporary, fine-grained permissions to cloud resources without managing static credentials.
*   **Regular Access Reviews:** Periodically review user accounts and service permissions to remove unnecessary access and ensure continued adherence to least privilege.

## 4. Network Security (Production Environment)

*   **Firewall Management:** Regularly review and update firewall rules (VPC security groups, network ACLs, host-based firewalls) to allow only necessary traffic.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Management:**
    *   Keep WAF rulesets up-to-date to protect against the latest threats.
    *   Monitor WAF logs for blocked requests and potential attacks.
    *   Tune WAF rules to minimize false positives while maximizing protection.
*   **IDS/IPS Monitoring:** Monitor alerts and logs from Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems.
*   **Kubernetes Network Policies:** Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to control traffic flow between pods within the cluster, enforcing microsegmentation.
*   **Egress Control:** Restrict outbound traffic from pods to only necessary external endpoints (e.g., payment gateways, fraud detection services).

## 5. Data Encryption Management (Operational)

*   **Key Management Operations:**
    *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate encryption keys (for data at rest, TLS certificates, API keys) according to defined policies and compliance requirements, using the chosen KMS.
    *   **Certificate Management:** Monitor TLS certificate expiration dates and renew them proactively. Securely manage private keys for certificates.
*   **Secure Storage of Keys and Certificates:** Ensure all cryptographic keys and certificates are stored securely within the KMS or other approved secure locations.
*   **Audit Key Usage:** Monitor and audit the usage of cryptographic keys.

## 6. Patch Management (Security Patches)

*   **Timely Patching:** Establish a process for promptly applying security patches to the underlying operating systems, Kubernetes components, database software, Kafka, and other third-party software in the production environment.
*   **Prioritization:** Prioritize patching based on vulnerability severity (e.g., CVSS scores) and exploitability.
*   **Testing:** Test patches in a staging environment before deploying to production to avoid regressions.

## 7. Security Logging and Monitoring (SecOps Focus)

*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor security logs and alerts (as detailed in `07-security-and-compliance/06-logging-and-monitoring-security-focus.md` and `08-deployment-operations/04-monitoring-and-alerting.md`).
*   **Threat Intelligence:** Stay informed about new and emerging threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the Payment Service or its underlying technologies.

Effective security operations are an ongoing effort that requires vigilance, proactive measures, and rapid response capabilities to protect the Payment Service and its sensitive data in the dynamic threat landscape.

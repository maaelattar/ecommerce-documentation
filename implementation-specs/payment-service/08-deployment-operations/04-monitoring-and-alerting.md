# 04: Monitoring and Alerting for Payment Service

Comprehensive monitoring and timely alerting are essential for maintaining the reliability, performance, and security of the Payment Service. This document outlines the strategy for metrics collection, logging, tracing, and alerting.

## 1. Key Metrics to Monitor

Metrics should provide insights into application performance, system health, business transactions, and error conditions.

### 1.1. Application Performance Metrics (APM)

*   **Request Rate:** Number of API requests per second/minute (overall and per endpoint).
*   **Request Latency:** Response time for API requests (average, median, 95th/99th percentiles).
*   **Error Rate:** Percentage of API requests resulting in errors (HTTP 4xx, 5xx), categorized by error code and endpoint.
*   **Resource Utilization (Pod Level):** CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O for Payment Service pods.
*   **Saturation Metrics:** Queue lengths (e.g., for asynchronous processing if applicable), thread pool usage.
*   **Dependency Latency:** Latency of calls to external services (database, Kafka, payment gateways, fraud detection services).

### 1.2. Business Transaction Metrics

*   **Payment Throughput:** Number of successful payments, refunds, and other key transactions processed per unit of time.
*   **Payment Success/Failure Rates:** Percentage of successful vs. failed payment attempts (categorized by reason for failure).
*   **Transaction Values:** Total value of payments processed.
*   **Fraud Metrics:** Number of transactions flagged/blocked by fraud detection, chargeback rates (if available to the service).
*   **Event Publishing Metrics:** Number of events published to Kafka, lag in event processing by consumers (if Payment Service also consumes events).

### 1.3. System Health Metrics (Underlying Infrastructure)

*   **Kubernetes Cluster Health:** Node status, resource availability (CPU, memory, disk), K8s control plane health.
*   **Database Performance:** CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, number of connections, query latency, replication lag (for HA setups).
*   **Kafka Cluster Health:** Broker status, topic/partition health, message throughput, consumer lag.

## 2. Logging Strategy

*   **Structured Logging:** Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for application logs. This allows for easier parsing, searching, and analysis in a centralized logging system.
    *   Include contextual information in logs: timestamp, log level, service name, request ID (correlation ID), user ID (if applicable), specific function/module name, and a descriptive message.
*   **Log Levels:** Use standard log levels (e.g., ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE).
    *   Production environments should typically log at INFO level or higher, with the ability to dynamically increase verbosity for specific components during troubleshooting.
*   **Centralized Logging System:** Ship all application and system logs to a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, Grafana Loki, AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging).
*   **Log Content:** Ensure logs contain sufficient detail for debugging and auditing, but AVOID logging sensitive PII or full payment details (e.g., PAN, CVV, full track data). Tokens are generally acceptable if managed securely.

## 3. Distributed Tracing

*   **Purpose:** To understand the end-to-end flow of requests as they travel across multiple microservices (e.g., API Gateway -> Order Service -> Payment Service -> Kafka).
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Integrate a distributed tracing library compatible with OpenTelemetry (preferred) or a specific tracing system (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray, Google Cloud Trace, Datadog APM).
    *   Ensure trace context (trace ID, span ID) is propagated across service calls (e.g., via HTTP headers, Kafka message headers).
*   **Benefits:** Helps identify performance bottlenecks, pinpoint errors in complex distributed transactions, and visualize service dependencies.

## 4. Alerting

*   **Alerting Platform:** Integrate with an alerting system (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana Alerting, Datadog Monitors, PagerDuty).
*   **Alert on Symptoms, Not Just Causes:** While alerting on high CPU is useful, it's often more important to alert on user-facing issues like high error rates or increased latency.
*   **Key Alert Categories:**
    *   **Critical Application Errors:** High API error rates (e.g., >5% 5xx errors for 5 mins), complete service unavailability.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Significant increase in request latency, high resource saturation.
    *   **Payment Failures:** Spike in payment transaction failures, issues with payment gateway integrations.
    *   **Security Alerts:** Based on security event monitoring (see `07-security-and-compliance/06-logging-and-monitoring-security-focus.md`).
    *   **Infrastructure Issues:** Database down, Kafka cluster issues, Kubernetes node failures.
    *   **Queue Lengths/Consumer Lag:** Significant backlog in processing Kafka messages.
*   **Actionable Alerts:** Alerts should be actionable and provide enough context for initial investigation. Avoid noisy or flapping alerts.
*   **Severity Levels:** Define alert severity levels (e.g., P1/Critical, P2/Error, P3/Warning) with corresponding notification channels and escalation policies.
*   **Notification Channels:** Email, Slack, SMS, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc., depending on severity and team on-call schedules.

## 5. Health Check Endpoints

*   **Purpose:** Provide a simple way for Kubernetes and other systems to check the health and readiness of Payment Service instances.
*   **Liveness Probe (`/healthz` or `/livez`):** Indicates if the application instance is running correctly. If this probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the pod.
    *   Should perform basic internal checks (e.g., application can respond, essential threads are alive).
*   **Readiness Probe (`/readyz`):** Indicates if the application instance is ready to accept traffic. If this probe fails, Kubernetes will not send traffic to the pod.
    *   Should check dependencies (e.g., database connectivity, Kafka connectivity, critical configurations loaded). An instance might be live but not ready if a downstream dependency is unavailable.
*   **Implementation:** Simple HTTP GET endpoints that return a `200 OK` status if healthy, and a `5xx` status if not.

By implementing a robust monitoring and alerting strategy, the operations team can proactively identify and address issues, ensuring the Payment Service remains stable, performant, and reliable.

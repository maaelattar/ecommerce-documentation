# 07: Backup and Disaster Recovery (DR) for Payment Service

A robust Backup and Disaster Recovery (DR) plan is essential for the Payment Service to ensure business continuity and data integrity in the event of system failures, data corruption, or major disasters.

## 1. Database Backup Strategy (PostgreSQL)

*   **Managed Service Capabilities:** Leverage backup features provided by managed PostgreSQL services (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL).
*   **Automated Backups:** Enable automated daily full snapshots of the database.
*   **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):** Enable transaction log archiving (e.g., WAL archiving in PostgreSQL) to allow for PITR to any point within the retention window (typically 7-35 days, configurable).
*   **Backup Retention:** Define a backup retention policy based on business requirements, compliance needs (e.g., PCI DSS), and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).
    *   Short-term retention for PITR (e.g., 14 days).
    *   Long-term retention for monthly or yearly snapshots if required for compliance or archival (store in cheaper storage if possible, e.g., S3 Glacier).
*   **Backup Encryption:** Ensure all database backups are encrypted at rest.
*   **Cross-Region Backups (for DR):** For enhanced disaster recovery, consider replicating snapshots or enabling cross-region replication of the database to a secondary DR region.
*   **Regular Restore Testing:**
    *   Periodically test the database backup and restore process by restoring backups to a separate, non-production environment.
    *   Verify data integrity and consistency of the restored database.
    *   Document the restore procedure and timing.

## 2. Kafka Data Replication and DR

*   **Topic Replication:** Configure Kafka topics with a replication factor of at least 3, spread across different brokers (and ideally different Availability Zones within the primary region) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for Kafka itself.
*   **Cross-Cluster Replication (for DR):** For disaster recovery, replicate Kafka topics and their data to a Kafka cluster in a secondary DR region.
    *   Tools like Confluent Replicator or Kafka MirrorMaker 2 can be used for this purpose.
    *   This ensures that event data is not lost if the primary region's Kafka cluster becomes unavailable.
*   **Consumer Offset Synchronization:** Ensure consumer offsets are also replicated or can be appropriately reset/managed in the DR environment to avoid reprocessing or skipping messages after a failover.

## 3. Application State and Configuration Data

*   **Stateless Application:** The Payment Service application itself should be designed to be stateless. Its state is primarily in the database and Kafka.
*   **Configuration Data:** Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets references) and CI/CD pipeline configurations should be stored in version control (Git). This allows for easy redeployment of the application and its configuration in a DR scenario.
*   **Docker Images:** Docker images are stored in a container registry, which should also be highly available and ideally replicated or accessible from the DR region.

## 4. Recovery Objectives

*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time (e.g., RPO of 15 minutes means no more than 15 minutes of data can be lost).
    *   For the database, PITR capabilities aim for a low RPO.
    *   For Kafka, continuous replication to DR helps achieve a low RPO for event data.
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The maximum acceptable downtime for the service to be restored after a disaster (e.g., RTO of 4 hours).
    *   RTO depends on the complexity of the failover process, infrastructure provisioning in DR, data restoration time, and application deployment time.
*   **Definition:** RPO and RTO values must be formally defined based on business impact analysis and agreed upon with stakeholders.

## 5. Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy

*   **DR Region:** Designate a secondary geographical region as the DR site.
*   **Failover Scenarios:** Define procedures for various DR scenarios:
    *   Full regional outage.
    *   Loss of primary database.
    *   Loss of primary Kafka cluster.
*   **Failover Process:**
    1.  **Decision to Failover:** Criteria and authority for declaring a disaster and initiating failover.
    2.  **Infrastructure Provisioning (if not hot-standby):** Spin up necessary infrastructure in the DR region (Kubernetes cluster, application instances) if using a warm or cold standby model.
    3.  **Data Restoration/Synchronization:**
        *   Promote DR database replica to primary or restore from cross-region backups.
        *   Switch Kafka producers and consumers to the DR Kafka cluster.
    4.  **Application Deployment:** Deploy Payment Service application instances in the DR region, pointing to the DR database and Kafka.
    5.  **DNS Failover:** Update DNS records or use global load balancing to redirect traffic to the Payment Service instances in the DR region.
    6.  **Verification:** Test basic functionality to ensure the service is operating correctly in the DR environment.
*   **Failback Process:** Define a procedure for failing back to the primary region once it is restored and stable. This is often more complex than failover and requires careful planning to avoid data loss or inconsistencies.

## 6. DR Drills and Testing

*   **Regular DR Drills:** Conduct periodic DR drills (e.g., annually or semi-annually) to test the effectiveness of the DR plan and identify weaknesses.
    *   **Tabletop Exercises:** Simulate a DR scenario and walk through the plan.
    *   **Partial Failover Tests:** Test failover of specific components (e.g., database) to the DR region.
    *   **Full Failover Tests (if feasible):** Conduct a full failover of the entire service to the DR region during a planned maintenance window.
*   **Documentation and Updates:** Keep DR plans and procedures well-documented and update them based on lessons learned from drills and changes in the system architecture.

By implementing a comprehensive backup and DR strategy, the Payment Service can minimize data loss and service disruption in the face of failures, ensuring business continuity for critical payment operations.

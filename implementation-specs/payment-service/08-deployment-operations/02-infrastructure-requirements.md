# 02: Infrastructure Requirements for Payment Service

This document outlines the key infrastructure components required to support the deployment, operation, and scaling of the Payment Service. These requirements are based on a Kubernetes-hosted microservice architecture.

## 1. Compute Resources (Kubernetes Cluster)

*   **Kubernetes Platform:** A managed Kubernetes service is preferred (e.g., Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS) to offload cluster management overhead.
    *   Alternatively, a self-managed Kubernetes cluster can be used if expertise and resources are available.
*   **Node Pools/Instance Types:**
    *   Sufficient worker nodes with appropriate CPU, memory, and network I/O capacity to run Payment Service pods and other system components.
    *   Consider using a mix of instance types optimized for general-purpose workloads or memory/CPU-intensive tasks if specific needs arise from performance testing.
    *   Node auto-scaling should be enabled for the cluster to adjust capacity based on load.
*   **Container Runtime:** A CRI-compliant container runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) as part of the Kubernetes worker node setup.

## 2. Database (PostgreSQL)

*   **Database Service:** A managed PostgreSQL service is highly recommended (e.g., Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL).
    *   This simplifies provisioning, patching, backups, high availability, and read replicas.
*   **High Availability (HA):** The database must be configured for high availability with automatic failover to a standby replica in a different availability zone (AZ).
*   **Performance:** Sufficient vCPUs, RAM, IOPS, and storage allocated to the database instance to handle the expected transaction load and data volume. Monitor and scale as needed.
*   **Connectivity:** Secure network connectivity between the Payment Service pods (in K8s) and the PostgreSQL instance. This typically involves VPC peering, private links, or carefully configured security groups/firewall rules.
*   **Backups:** Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery (PITR) capabilities. Backup retention policies must be defined.

## 3. Message Broker (Apache Kafka)

*   **Kafka Service:** A managed Kafka service is recommended (e.g., Amazon MSK, Confluent Cloud, Azure Event Hubs for Kafka).
    *   Simplifies cluster setup, scaling, and maintenance.
*   **Cluster Sizing:** Sufficient brokers, partitions, and replication factor to handle the expected event throughput and provide fault tolerance.
*   **Topics:** Dedicated Kafka topics for payment-related events (e.g., `payment.events`).
*   **Data Retention:** Define data retention policies for Kafka topics based on business needs and reprocessing requirements.
*   **Connectivity:** Secure network connectivity between Payment Service pods and the Kafka cluster.

## 4. Networking

*   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** The entire infrastructure should reside within a secure, isolated VPC.
*   **Subnets:** Use private subnets for Kubernetes worker nodes, databases, and Kafka brokers. Public subnets for internet-facing load balancers or API Gateways.
*   **Load Balancers/Ingress:**
    *   An Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress, Traefik) or a cloud provider's load balancer to manage external access to the Payment Service APIs (typically via an API Gateway).
    *   Internal load balancers (Kubernetes Services of type `ClusterIP`) for service-to-service communication.
*   **API Gateway:** An API Gateway (e.g., Amazon API Gateway, Apigee, Kong) to manage, secure, and expose Payment Service APIs. It handles concerns like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and request routing.
*   **Firewall/Security Groups:** Strict firewall rules and security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic at all layers (VPC, subnets, instances, Kubernetes network policies).
*   **DNS:** Reliable DNS services for resolving internal and external service endpoints.
*   **NAT Gateway/Egress Control:** If pods in private subnets need outbound internet access (e.g., to communicate with external payment gateways), use a NAT Gateway. Implement egress filtering if possible.

## 5. Secrets Management

*   **Dedicated Solution:** A dedicated secrets management solution is required to securely store and manage sensitive information like database credentials, API keys for payment gateways, encryption keys, and TLS certificates.
*   **Options:**
    *   HashiCorp Vault
    *   AWS Secrets Manager
    *   Azure Key Vault
    *   Google Cloud Secret Manager
*   **Integration with Kubernetes:** The chosen solution should integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes to allow pods to securely retrieve secrets at runtime (e.g., using a CSI driver, sidecar injector, or init container).
*   **Access Control:** Strict access control policies defining which services or pods can access specific secrets.
*   **Auditing:** Audit logs for all secret access and management operations.

## 6. Logging and Monitoring Infrastructure

*   **Centralized Logging:** A centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; Splunk; Grafana Loki) to collect, store, and analyze logs from the Payment Service, Kubernetes, and other infrastructure components.
*   **Metrics Collection:** A monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, Dynatrace) to collect metrics on application performance, resource utilization, and system health.
*   **Alerting System:** An alerting system integrated with the monitoring solution to notify operations and security teams of critical issues.

These infrastructure components provide the foundation for a secure, scalable, and resilient Payment Service.

# 06: Logging and Monitoring (Security Focus) for Payment Service

Comprehensive logging and vigilant monitoring are critical for detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents within the Payment Service. This document focuses on the security-specific aspects of logging and monitoring.

## 1. Audit Trails for Sensitive Operations

Immutable and detailed audit trails must be maintained for all sensitive operations and changes to security configurations.

*   **Events to Audit:**
    *   Payment initiation, authorization, capture, void, and refund attempts (successful and failed).
    *   Changes to payment method details (creation, update, deletion of tokens).
    *   Access to sensitive data (e.g., viewing transaction details by admin users).
    *   User authentication and authorization events (logins, logouts, permission changes for admin UIs, if any).
    *   System-level authentication events (e.g., service-to-service authentication successes/failures).
    *   Changes to security configurations (e.g., fraud rules, API key management, access control policies).
    *   Webhook receipt and processing, including signature verification results.
    *   Calls to and responses from external payment gateways and fraud detection services.
*   **Information to Log per Event:**
    *   Timestamp (accurate and synchronized).
    *   Source IP address (where applicable and available).
    *   Authenticated user ID or service ID performing the action.
    *   Resource affected (e.g., Payment ID, Transaction ID, User ID).
    *   Action performed (e.g., `PAYMENT_INITIATED`, `REFUND_FAILED`, `CONFIG_UPDATED`).
    *   Outcome (success, failure, reason for failure).
    *   Correlation IDs to link related events across services.
*   **Log Integrity and Protection:**
    *   Logs should be write-once, read-many (immutable or append-only).
    *   Protect logs from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.
    *   Consider centralized logging to a secure, dedicated logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk).
    *   Regularly back up audit logs.

## 2. Security Event Logging

Beyond standard operational logs, specific security-related events need to be logged for threat detection and analysis.

*   **Authentication Failures:** Repeated login failures, invalid token attempts, mTLS handshake failures.
*   **Authorization Failures:** Attempts to access resources or perform actions without sufficient permissions.
*   **Input Validation Failures:** Repeated or suspicious input validation errors (e.g., SQLi patterns, XSS probes detected by WAF or application).
*   **Anomalous Activity:** Unusual patterns of API calls, unexpected data in requests, high rates of errors from a specific source.
*   **Security Tool Alerts:** Alerts from Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), or integrated security services.
*   **Webhook Anomalies:** Unexpected or malformed webhooks, signature verification failures.
*   **Changes to Critical Files/Configuration:** If applicable at the host or container level (though less common for application-level focus).

## 3. Security Monitoring and Alerting

Proactive monitoring of security logs and events is crucial for timely detection of potential incidents.

*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
    *   Integrate Payment Service security logs with a SIEM solution.
    *   Develop correlation rules in the SIEM to detect suspicious patterns and potential attacks (e.g., brute-force attempts, unusual data exfiltration patterns, multiple failed payments followed by a success from a new IP).
*   **Real-time Alerting:**
    *   Configure real-time alerts for high-priority security events (e.g., critical system errors, detected intrusions, significant fraud signals, repeated authentication failures for admin accounts).
    *   Alerts should be sent to the appropriate security operations team or on-call personnel.
    *   Define clear escalation paths for different types of alerts.
*   **Dashboards and Visualization:**
    *   Create security-focused dashboards to visualize key security metrics, trends, and active alerts.
    *   Examples: Number of failed authentications, authorization denials, WAF blocked requests, fraud attempt rates.
*   **Regular Review:** Security logs and alerts should be reviewed regularly by security personnel, even if no immediate critical alerts are triggered, to identify subtle anomalies or emerging threats.

## 4. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

*   **Network IDS/IPS:** Monitor network traffic for known malicious signatures and anomalous behavior. Typically deployed at the network perimeter or key network segments.
*   **Host-based IDS/IPS (HIDS/HIPS):** Monitor activity on individual servers or containers for signs of compromise.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   Deploy a WAF (e.g., AWS WAF, Azure Application Gateway WAF, Cloudflare) in front of the Payment Service APIs (or at the API Gateway level).
    *   Configure WAF rules to block common web attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and malicious bots.
    *   Regularly update WAF rulesets.

## 5. Log Retention

*   Define a log retention policy based on business needs, regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI DSS often requires at least one year for audit logs, with three months immediately available), and storage capacity.
*   Ensure that logs are retained securely for the defined period and can be accessed for investigations when needed.

By implementing these security-focused logging and monitoring practices, the Payment Service can enhance its ability to detect threats, respond to incidents effectively, and meet compliance obligations.

# 01: Data Security in Payment Service

Data security is a cornerstone of the Payment Service, responsible for protecting sensitive financial information from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction. This document outlines the key strategies and mechanisms for ensuring robust data security.

## 1. Encryption

Sensitive data handled by the Payment Service must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

### 1.1. Encryption in Transit

*   **Protocols:** All communication channels transmitting sensitive payment data (e.g., between services, to/from payment gateways, client to API Gateway) MUST use strong, industry-standard encryption protocols, primarily TLS 1.2 or higher (TLS 1.3 preferred).
*   **Certificate Management:** Proper management of SSL/TLS certificates is crucial, including acquisition from trusted CAs, secure storage, timely renewal, and revocation if compromised.
*   **Internal Communication:** Service-to-service communication within the cluster (e.g., between Payment Service and Order Service, or Payment Service and its database) should also be encrypted using mTLS (mutual TLS) where appropriate to ensure both parties are authenticated and data is secure.

### 1.2. Encryption at Rest

*   **Database Encryption:** Sensitive data stored in the Payment Service database (e.g., PostgreSQL) MUST be encrypted at rest. This can be achieved through:
    *   **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):** Offered by many database systems, encrypts the entire database or specific tables/columns automatically.
    *   **Application-Level Encryption:** Encrypting specific sensitive fields (e.g., certain payment method details, though full PAN data should not be stored) within the application before writing to the database. This provides more granular control but adds complexity.
*   **Storage Encryption:** Encryption of underlying storage volumes (e.g., EBS volumes on AWS, Persistent Disks on GCP) where database files, logs, or backups are stored.
*   **Backup Encryption:** All backups of the Payment Service database and related sensitive data must be encrypted.
*   **Algorithm Strength:** Use strong, industry-accepted encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) and appropriate key lengths.

## 2. Tokenization

Tokenization is a critical security measure for handling Primary Account Numbers (PAN) and other sensitive payment card information, significantly reducing the PCI DSS scope.

*   **Process:** Instead of storing raw PAN data, the Payment Service will integrate with a payment gateway or a dedicated tokenization vault. When a PAN is first captured (typically client-side directly to the gateway or a secure gateway-hosted field), it is exchanged for a non-sensitive token.
*   **Token Usage:** The Payment Service will store and use these tokens for subsequent transactions (e.g., recurring payments, refunds). The actual PAN is securely stored by the PCI DSS compliant gateway/vault.
*   **PAN Data Handling:** The Payment Service itself SHOULD NOT store, process, or transmit raw PAN data after initial tokenization, except under very specific, controlled, and PCI DSS compliant circumstances if absolutely unavoidable (which should be designed against).
*   **Gateway Tokens vs. Customer Tokens:** Differentiate between tokens used for specific transactions and tokens representing a customer's stored payment method with the gateway (CustomerGatewayToken entity).

## 3. Secure Key Management

Effective management of cryptographic keys is essential for the security of encrypted data.

*   **Key Management System (KMS):** Utilize a dedicated KMS (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) for generating, storing, rotating, and managing access to cryptographic keys.
*   **Key Hierarchy:** Implement a key hierarchy (e.g., Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) encrypted by Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) managed by the KMS) to protect DEKs.
*   **Access Control:** Strict access controls on who/what can access and use keys. The Payment Service should have tightly controlled permissions to use keys for encryption/decryption operations via the KMS.
*   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate cryptographic keys according to a defined policy and compliance requirements.
*   **Auditability:** All key management operations (creation, rotation, deletion, usage) must be auditable.

## 4. Data Masking

Data masking is used to obscure specific data fields when displayed or used in non-production environments (e.g., testing, development, analytics) or for roles that do not require access to the full sensitive data.

*   **Purpose:** Protects sensitive data from unintentional exposure while still providing usable data for certain purposes.
*   **Techniques:** Examples include replacing characters with asterisks (e.g., showing only the last 4 digits of a card: `**** **** **** 1234`), nulling out fields, or replacing with realistic but fictitious data.
*   **Implementation:** Can be implemented at the application level, database level, or through specialized data masking tools.
*   **Scope:** Identify fields requiring masking, such as partial payment method details (if any are displayed), personally identifiable information (PII) linked to payments, etc.

## 5. Access Controls (Data-Level)

Beyond service-level authorization, implement fine-grained access controls to the data itself.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users and services should only have access to the specific data elements required for their legitimate tasks.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles with specific permissions to view, modify, or manage sensitive payment data.
*   **Database Permissions:** Utilize database-level permissions to restrict access to tables, columns, and operations based on the application user's role connecting to the database.

By implementing these data security measures comprehensively, the Payment Service aims to create a secure environment for handling financial transactions and protecting customer data.

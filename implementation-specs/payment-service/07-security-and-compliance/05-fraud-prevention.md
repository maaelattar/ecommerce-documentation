# 05: Fraud Prevention in Payment Service

Preventing fraudulent transactions is a critical function of the Payment Service, protecting both the business and its customers. This involves a combination of integrating with specialized third-party fraud detection services and implementing internal checks and rules.

## 1. Integration with Fraud Detection Services

Leveraging dedicated fraud detection services (FDS) is often the most effective way to identify and block sophisticated fraud attempts.

*   **Selection Criteria for FDS:**
    *   Accuracy (low false positives and false negatives).
    *   Integration capabilities (APIs, webhooks).
    *   Machine learning capabilities and adaptive models.
    *   Range of fraud signals considered (device fingerprinting, IP geolocation, behavioral analytics, historical data).
    *   Customization options for rules and risk scoring.
    *   Real-time decisioning capabilities.
    *   Compliance (e.g., GDPR).
*   **Integration Pattern:**
    1.  **Data Collection:** The Payment Service (or potentially upstream services like Order Service, with data relayed) collects relevant data points for fraud assessment. This can include:
        *   Order details (items, amounts, shipping address, billing address).
        *   User account information (age of account, transaction history).
        *   Payment method details (type, BIN, AVS/CVV results from gateway).
        *   Device information (IP address, user agent, device fingerprint - often collected client-side and passed to FDS).
        *   Behavioral data (if available).
    2.  **Sending Data to FDS:** Before or concurrently with authorizing a payment, the Payment Service sends the collected data to the FDS via API.
    3.  **Receiving Risk Score/Decision:** The FDS analyzes the data and returns a risk score, a decision (e.g., approve, review, reject), and potentially reasons or flags.
    4.  **Action Based on FDS Response:**
        *   **Approve:** Proceed with payment authorization.
        *   **Reject:** Decline the payment and inform the user appropriately. Log the event.
        *   **Review:** Flag the transaction for manual review by a fraud team. The payment might be authorized but held, or declined pending review, depending on policy.
*   **Data Flow:** Ensure sensitive data sent to FDS is handled securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
*   **Webhook Updates:** Some FDS might provide asynchronous updates via webhooks if a transaction's risk assessment changes post-authorization.

## 2. Internal Fraud Rules and Velocity Checks

In addition to external FDS, the Payment Service can implement its own set of rules and velocity checks as a first line of defense or to complement the FDS.

*   **Rule Engine:** Consider implementing a simple internal rule engine or a configurable set of checks.
*   **Examples of Internal Rules:**
    *   **Velocity Checks:**
        *   Number of transactions from the same IP address, user account, or payment method within a short time period.
        *   Value of transactions from a new account.
        *   Frequency of adding new payment methods.
    *   **Consistency Checks:**
        *   Billing address vs. shipping address mismatch (can be legitimate, but is a factor).
        *   IP geolocation vs. billing/shipping country.
    *   **Blocklists/Allowlists:**
        *   Blocking transactions from known fraudulent IP addresses, email domains, or user accounts.
        *   Allowlisting trusted users for certain checks.
    *   **High-Risk Indicators:**
        *   Use of disposable email addresses.
        *   Attempts to use multiple payment methods in rapid succession after failures.
        *   Unusual order patterns.
*   **Configuration:** These rules should be configurable and tunable based on observed fraud patterns and business needs.

## 3. AVS and CVV Checks

*   **Address Verification System (AVS):** The Payment Service should ensure the payment gateway performs AVS checks (comparing the numeric parts of the billing address with the card issuer's records).
*   **Card Verification Value (CVV/CVC2/CID):** The gateway must also perform CVV checks.
*   **Response Handling:** The Payment Service should receive AVS/CVV response codes from the gateway and can use these as input into its fraud decisioning logic (either internal rules or data sent to FDS). For example, a CVV mismatch is a strong indicator of potential fraud.
*   **Note:** The Payment Service itself MUST NOT store CVV codes.

## 4. Manual Review Process

*   For transactions flagged for review (either by FDS or internal rules), a defined manual review process is necessary.
*   This involves a fraud analyst or team examining the transaction details to make a final decision.
*   Clear workflows and tools are needed to support efficient manual review.

## 5. Feedback Loop and Model Retraining

*   **Chargeback Data:** Incorporate chargeback data into the fraud prevention system. When a chargeback occurs due to fraud, this information should be used to refine rules and provide feedback to the FDS (if supported) to improve its models.
*   **Manual Review Outcomes:** Outcomes of manual reviews (fraudulent or legitimate) should also be fed back to update rules and potentially retrain FDS models.

## 6. User Communication

*   Communicate clearly with users when a payment is declined due to suspected fraud, without revealing sensitive details of fraud detection mechanisms.
*   Provide a way for legitimate users to resolve issues if their transactions are incorrectly flagged (false positives).

By combining these strategies, the Payment Service can establish a multi-layered defense against payment fraud, adapting to evolving threats and minimizing losses.

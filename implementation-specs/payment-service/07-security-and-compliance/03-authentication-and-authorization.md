# 03: Authentication and Authorization in Payment Service

Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms are essential to ensure that only legitimate users and services can access and perform operations within the Payment Service. This document outlines the strategies for both internal (service-to-service) and external (API) security, as well as fine-grained access control.

## 1. Service-to-Service Authentication

Ensuring that internal services communicating with the Payment Service are genuine and authorized is crucial.

*   **Mechanism:** Mutual TLS (mTLS) is the preferred method for service-to-service authentication within the Kubernetes cluster or internal network.
    *   Each service (Payment Service, Order Service, etc.) has its own X.509 certificate issued by an internal Certificate Authority (CA).
    *   When services communicate, they present their certificates, and both parties verify the other's identity against the trusted internal CA.
    *   This ensures that traffic is from a known and trusted service within the platform.
*   **Alternative/Complementary:** OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow can also be used, where services authenticate using a client ID and secret to obtain an access token from a central identity provider (e.g., the platform's main Auth Service or a dedicated one like Keycloak/Okta).
    *   The Payment Service would then validate these tokens.
    *   This can be useful if mTLS is challenging to implement across all service interactions or for services outside the immediate cluster.
*   **Secrets Management:** Client secrets or private keys for mTLS certificates must be securely managed using a secrets management solution (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets with Vault integration, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

## 2. API Authentication (External Interactions)

External clients or services (e.g., an API Gateway, or directly if applicable for specific admin/partner integrations) interacting with Payment Service APIs need strong authentication.

*   **Primary Mechanism:** OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens (specifically, JWTs - JSON Web Tokens) are the standard.
    *   Clients obtain a JWT from the central Authentication Service after successful user login or client credential authentication.
    *   This JWT is then included in the `Authorization` header of API requests to the Payment Service (typically via an API Gateway that validates the token).
    *   The Payment Service (or the Gateway) validates the token's signature, expiration, issuer, and audience.
*   **API Keys (Limited Use):** For specific, trusted third-party server-to-server integrations (e.g., a payment gateway webhook receiver if not using other signature verification methods), API keys might be considered.
    *   Keys must be unique per client, securely generated, transmitted, and stored.
    *   They should have configurable permissions and be revocable.
    *   This is generally less secure and flexible than OAuth 2.0 and should be used sparingly with strict controls.
*   **Webhook Signature Verification:** For incoming webhooks (e.g., from payment gateways), the Payment Service MUST verify the signature of the webhook payload using a shared secret or public key provided by the gateway. This ensures the webhook is authentic and its content hasn't been tampered with.

## 3. Authorization (Fine-Grained Access Control)

Once a user or service is authenticated, authorization determines what actions they are permitted to perform.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   Define roles within the Payment Service context (e.g., `PaymentAdmin`, `RefundProcessor`, `OrderServiceInternal`, `ViewOnlyUser`).
    *   Assign specific permissions to these roles (e.g., `payment:create`, `refund:process`, `transaction:view`, `payment_method:delete`).
    *   User accounts (for administrative UIs) or service identities (for S2S calls) are mapped to these roles.
*   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) - Optional Enhancement:** For more dynamic and granular control, ABAC can be considered. Policies can take into account attributes of the user/service, the resource being accessed, and the environment.
    *   Example: Only allow a `RefundProcessor` from the `EU_Region` to process refunds for payments originating in the EU.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **JWT Claims:** For external API calls, relevant roles or permissions can be embedded as claims within the JWT. The Payment Service (or API Gateway) extracts these to make authorization decisions.
    *   **Internal Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** The Payment Service should have an internal module (PEP) that checks permissions before executing any sensitive operation. This PEP would consult a Policy Decision Point (PDP), which could be a simple internal map of roles to permissions or integrate with a more sophisticated authorization service (e.g., Open Policy Agent - OPA).
    *   **Database-Level Security:** Complement application-level authorization with database user roles and permissions to limit direct data access, even if an attacker bypasses application layers (defense in depth).
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Always grant the minimum necessary permissions for a user or service to perform its function.

## 4. Securing Sensitive Endpoints

*   Endpoints that perform critical operations (e.g., initiating high-value payments, configuring gateway settings, managing payment methods) MUST have stricter authentication and authorization controls.
*   Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access to sensitive functionalities if a UI is involved.
*   Rate limiting and IP whitelisting/blacklisting can provide additional layers of protection for these endpoints, typically managed at the API Gateway level.

By implementing these comprehensive authentication and authorization strategies, the Payment Service can ensure that access to its resources and operations is strictly controlled and auditable.

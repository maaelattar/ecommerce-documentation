# 09: Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) Practices for Payment Service

Integrating security into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDL) for the Payment Service is crucial for building and maintaining a secure application. A proactive SDL approach helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities early, reducing the cost and effort of fixing them later.

## 1. Overview of SDL for Payment Service

The SDL for the Payment Service will incorporate security activities at each stage:

1.  **Training:** Equipping the development team with security knowledge.
2.  **Requirements:** Defining security requirements alongside functional requirements.
3.  **Design:** Incorporating security principles into the architecture and design.
4.  **Implementation (Coding):** Writing secure code and avoiding common pitfalls.
5.  **Verification (Testing):** Performing various security testing activities.
6.  **Release:** Securely deploying the application.
7.  **Response (Post-Release):** Handling incidents and maintaining security post-deployment.

## 2. Training

*   **Security Awareness:** All team members involved in the Payment Service development (developers, QA, DevOps, product owners) should receive regular security awareness training.
*   **Secure Coding Training:** Developers must receive specialized training on secure coding practices relevant to the technology stack (Node.js, TypeScript, NestJS, PostgreSQL) and common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25).
*   **Role-Specific Training:** Training tailored to specific roles (e.g., security for architects, secure configuration for DevOps).

## 3. Requirements Phase

*   **Security Requirements Definition:** Explicitly define security requirements alongside functional requirements for new features or changes.
    *   Examples: "All sensitive data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.2+.", "User input must be validated to prevent XSS.", "Access to admin functions requires multi-factor authentication."
*   **Compliance Requirements:** Identify and incorporate all relevant compliance requirements (PCI DSS, GDPR, etc.) from the outset.
*   **Abuse Cases:** Define potential ways an attacker might abuse features and design countermeasures.

## 4. Design Phase

*   **Threat Modeling:**
    *   Conduct threat modeling sessions for new features or significant architectural changes to identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and design appropriate mitigations.
    *   Use methodologies like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).
*   **Security Architecture Review:** Review the proposed architecture from a security perspective, ensuring it aligns with security principles (e.g., defense in depth, least privilege, secure defaults).
*   **Secure Design Patterns:** Utilize established secure design patterns (e.g., input validation, centralized authentication/authorization, secure error handling).
*   **Technology Selection:** Choose technologies and libraries with strong security track records and active maintenance.

## 5. Implementation (Coding) Phase

*   **Adherence to Secure Coding Standards:** Follow established secure coding guidelines and best practices for the languages and frameworks used.
*   **Peer Code Reviews (Security Focus):** Security should be a key aspect of all code reviews. Reviewers should specifically look for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Use of Approved Libraries and Frameworks:** Prefer using well-vetted, secure libraries and framework features over custom-building security-critical components (e.g., use established encryption libraries, ORMs for database access).
*   **Secrets Management:** Ensure secrets (API keys, passwords, certificates) are not hardcoded in source code but managed through a secure secrets management system.

## 6. Verification (Testing) Phase

*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Conduct DAST scans against the running application in test environments to identify vulnerabilities at runtime.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (as detailed in `07-vulnerability-management.md`).
*   **Manual Security Testing/Penetration Testing:** Perform regular manual penetration tests (especially for significant releases) by internal or external security teams.
*   **Fuzz Testing:** Consider fuzz testing for critical input vectors to discover unexpected behavior or crashes that might indicate vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Regression Testing:** Ensure that fixes for previously identified vulnerabilities remain in place and new changes do not reintroduce them.

## 7. Release Phase

*   **Secure Configuration Management:** Ensure that production environments are configured securely (e.g., disabling debug modes, applying security hardening to servers and services).
*   **Change Management:** Follow a formal change management process for deploying new code or configuration changes to production, including a security review.
*   **Secure Deployment Practices:** Use secure pipelines (CI/CD) with appropriate access controls and auditing for deployments.

## 8. Response (Post-Release) Phase

*   **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan in place (as detailed in `08-incident-response.md`).
*   **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:** Establish a policy for how external security researchers can report vulnerabilities.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the application and infrastructure for security events and anomalies.
*   **Patch Management:** Promptly address and patch vulnerabilities discovered post-release.
*   **Periodic Security Reviews:** Conduct periodic reviews of the Payment Service's security posture even in the absence of specific incidents.

By embedding these SDL practices throughout the lifecycle of the Payment Service, the aim is to develop and maintain a resilient and secure system capable of protecting sensitive payment information and resisting attacks.

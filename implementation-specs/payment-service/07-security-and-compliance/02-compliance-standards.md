# 02: Compliance Standards for Payment Service

Adherence to relevant compliance standards is mandatory for the Payment Service due to its handling of sensitive payment card information and personal data. This document outlines the key compliance frameworks and considerations.

## 1. PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

PCI DSS is the most critical compliance standard for any entity that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data. The primary goal for the Payment Service architecture is to **minimize PCI DSS scope**.

### 1.1. Scope Reduction Strategies

*   **Tokenization:** As detailed in `01-data-security.md`, using a third-party, PCI DSS compliant payment gateway to tokenize Primary Account Numbers (PANs) is the primary strategy. The Payment Service will primarily handle tokens, not raw PANs.
*   **Outsourcing Card Data Functions:** Offloading card data capture to the payment gateway (e.g., using their hosted payment pages, iFrames, or client-side encryption libraries like Stripe.js or Braintree.js) prevents sensitive cardholder data from transiting or being stored in the Payment Service's environment.
*   **Network Segmentation:** If any part of the Payment Service environment were to be in scope (which is to be avoided), strict network segmentation would be required to isolate the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) from other parts of the system.

### 1.2. Responsibilities Even with Reduced Scope

Even when significantly reducing scope, the Payment Service and the broader organization still have responsibilities:

*   **SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire):** Depending on the integration method with the payment gateway, a specific SAQ (e.g., SAQ A, SAQ A-EP) will need to be completed annually.
*   **Due Diligence on Third Parties:** Ensuring that the chosen payment gateways and other relevant service providers are PCI DSS compliant (Attestation of Compliance - AoC).
*   **Secure Development Practices:** Applying secure coding practices to the Payment Service, even if it doesn't handle PANs directly, as it interacts with the payment process.
*   **Incident Response:** Having a plan for security incidents, even if they don't directly involve PAN compromise within the service's systems.

### 1.3. Key PCI DSS Requirements (Considerations for Interacting Systems)

While aiming to de-scope, understanding PCI DSS principles helps in designing secure interactions:

*   **Req 3:** Protect stored cardholder data (achieved by not storing it).
*   **Req 4:** Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks (achieved by using gateway-provided secure methods and TLS for API calls).
*   **Req 6:** Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.
*   **Req 8:** Identify and authenticate access to system components.
*   **Req 10:** Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data (relevant for logs of token usage).

## 2. Data Privacy Regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

Payment data is often linked to personal data, making data privacy regulations highly relevant.

### 2.1. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) - Europe

*   **Lawful Basis for Processing:** Payment processing is typically covered under "performance of a contract."
*   **Data Subject Rights:** Users have rights to access, rectify, erase (right to be forgotten), and port their personal data. The Payment Service must be able to support these requests, even for tokenized data (e.g., deleting customer gateway tokens).
*   **Data Minimization:** Collect and retain only the personal data necessary for payment processing.
*   **Security of Processing:** Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security (covered in `01-data-security.md`).
*   **Data Breach Notification:** Procedures for notifying authorities and affected individuals in case of a personal data breach.
*   **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs):** May be required for high-risk processing activities.

### 2.2. CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) / CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) - USA

*   **Consumer Rights:** Similar rights to GDPR, including right to know, delete, and opt-out of sale/sharing of personal information.
*   **Definition of Personal Information:** Broad definition that includes information that can be linked to a household, which payment data often is.

### 2.3. Other Local and Regional Regulations

*   The Payment Service must be designed to accommodate other local or regional data privacy and financial regulations depending on the markets served (e.g., PIPEDA in Canada, LGPD in Brazil).
*   A flexible design that allows for jurisdiction-specific configurations or data handling rules may be necessary.

## 3. Other Relevant Financial Regulations

Depending on the specific nature of payment methods supported and regions of operation, other financial regulations might apply:

*   **PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2) - Europe:** Particularly Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements if the Payment Service is involved in customer authentication for payments.
*   **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC):** While the Payment Service itself may not be directly responsible for AML/KYC (often handled by User service or dedicated identity services), it must securely provide data to support these processes and protect against misuse for financial crime.

## 4. Maintaining Compliance

*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct internal and potentially external audits against relevant standards.
*   **Policy and Procedure Updates:** Keep policies and procedures aligned with evolving regulations.
*   **Training:** Ensure relevant personnel are trained on compliance requirements and security best practices.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor for changes in regulations and assess their impact on the Payment Service.

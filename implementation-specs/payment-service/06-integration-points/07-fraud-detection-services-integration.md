# 07: Fraud Detection Services Integration

To minimize financial losses due to fraudulent transactions, the Payment Service often integrates with specialized external fraud detection services. Some payment gateways (like Stripe Radar or PayPal Fraud Protection) also offer built-in advanced fraud prevention tools that act as an integrated fraud service.

## Integration Purpose

*   **Risk Scoring**: To obtain a risk score or assessment for each transaction before it is processed or authorized.
*   **Decision Making**: To receive a recommendation (e.g., `approve`, `review`, `reject`/`block`) based on the risk assessment.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: To leverage the sophisticated machine learning models and vast datasets of specialized fraud services to identify complex fraud patterns that might be invisible to simple rules engines.
*   **Reduced Chargebacks**: To proactively block fraudulent transactions and reduce chargeback rates.

## Integration Flow (Typical for External Service)

This flow involves the `FraudDetectionService` component within the Payment Service.

1.  **Data Collection**: Before initiating a payment or authorization with the payment gateway, the `PaymentProcessingService` gathers relevant data for fraud assessment. This data can include:
    *   Transaction details: Amount, currency, items in cart (summary).
    *   Payment method details: Card BIN (first 6 digits), card type, last four digits (never full PAN to this service unless it's the PCI-compliant gateway itself providing fraud tools on tokenized data).
    *   User details: `userId`, email, account age, order history, IP address.
    *   Device fingerprinting: Information collected by client-side scripts (if a fraud service provides such scripts).
    *   Billing and shipping addresses.
    *   Gateway-specific tokens or session IDs (e.g., Stripe Radar session).

2.  **API Call to Fraud Service**: The `FraudDetectionService` sends this collected data to the external fraud detection service via its API.

3.  **Receive Assessment**: The fraud service responds with:
    *   A risk score (e.g., 0-100).
    *   A recommendation (`approve`, `review`, `reject`).
    *   Reason codes or a list of triggered rules/risk factors.
    *   A unique transaction ID from the fraud service for reference.

4.  **Internal Decision**: The `PaymentProcessingService` (or `FraudDetectionService`) uses the assessment to decide the next action:
    *   **Approve**: Proceed with the payment gateway transaction.
    *   **Review**: Place the order/payment on hold for manual review by an internal team. Publish an event like `PaymentRequiresReview`.
    *   **Reject/Block**: Do not proceed with the payment. Inform the user appropriately (e.g., "Transaction cannot be processed"). Publish a `PaymentFailed` event with a specific fraud-related reason.

5.  **Feedback Loop (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   For machine learning-based fraud services, providing feedback on the outcome of transactions (especially those manually reviewed or later identified as fraudulent via chargebacks) helps improve the accuracy of the fraud models.
    *   This might involve sending updates to the fraud service API (e.g., marking a transaction as confirmed fraud or confirmed legitimate).

## Integration with Gateway-Provided Fraud Tools

*   If using fraud tools provided directly by the payment gateway (e.g., Stripe Radar rules, PayPal Fraud Management Filters):
    *   The integration is often more seamless.
    *   The gateway itself performs the risk assessment when a payment or payment intent is created.
    *   The gateway's API response for payment creation/authorization will include fraud assessment details (e.g., Stripe's `outcome` object with `risk_level` and `rule` triggered).
    *   The Payment Service then acts based on this information from the gateway.
    *   Custom rules can often be configured directly in the gateway's dashboard.

## Data Exchanged

*   **To Fraud Service**: As listed in Data Collection above. Minimize sensitive PII where possible, but fraud services often require rich data for accuracy.
*   **From Fraud Service**: Risk score, recommendation, reason codes, fraud service transaction ID.

## Security and Compliance

*   **API Key Security**: Credentials for accessing external fraud service APIs must be stored securely.
*   **Data Privacy (PII)**: Understand the data handling and privacy policies of the chosen fraud service. Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR/CCPA. Obtain user consent if necessary for sharing data with third-party fraud services.
*   **HTTPS**: All API communication must be over HTTPS.

## Considerations

*   **Latency**: Calls to external fraud services add latency to the payment authorization process. Choose services with low latency and implement appropriate timeouts.
*   **Cost**: External fraud services usually have a per-transaction fee or a tiered pricing model.
*   **False Positives**: Tune rules and thresholds carefully to minimize the blocking of legitimate transactions (false positives), which can lead to customer dissatisfaction and lost sales.
*   **Fallback Strategy**: If the external fraud service is unavailable, the Payment Service needs a fallback strategy: fail open (approve transactions, possibly with higher risk), fail closed (reject transactions), or use a simpler internal ruleset temporarily.

Integrating with a robust fraud detection service is a critical step in protecting the e-commerce platform from financial losses and maintaining a secure environment for legitimate customers.

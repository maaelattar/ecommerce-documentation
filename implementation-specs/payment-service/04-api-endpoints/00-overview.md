# 00: API Endpoints - Overview

This section defines the API endpoints exposed by the Payment Service. These endpoints allow clients (such as the frontend application via an API Gateway, or other backend services in specific trusted scenarios) to interact with the payment functionalities.

All endpoints must be secured with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Sensitive data in requests and responses must be handled according to PCI DSS guidelines (e.g., using tokens, avoiding direct transmission of raw card details to these backend endpoints).

## Endpoint Categories:

1.  **Payment Initiation and Processing (`01-payment-initiation-processing-endpoints.md`)**:
    *   Endpoints for creating payment intents, processing payments, and handling payment confirmations or actions required by the user (e.g., 3D Secure).

2.  **Payment Method Management (`02-payment-method-management-endpoints.md`)**:
    *   Endpoints for users to add, list, set as default, and delete their saved payment methods.

3.  **Refund Processing (`03-refund-processing-endpoints.md`)**:
    *   Endpoints for initiating and querying the status of refunds. These might be restricted to admin users or specific service roles.

4.  **Transaction History (`04-transaction-history-endpoints.md`)**:
    *   Endpoints for retrieving payment and transaction history for a user or an order. Access controls are critical here.

5.  **Webhook Handling (`05-webhook-handling-endpoints.md`)**:
    *   Endpoints dedicated to receiving asynchronous notifications (webhooks) from external payment gateways. These are not typically called by end-users or client applications but are targeted by the gateways themselves.

6.  **Gateway Configuration (Admin - Optional) (`06-gateway-configuration-endpoints.md`)**:
    *   Optional endpoints for administrators to manage payment gateway configurations if such dynamic management is required and built into the service (e.g., enabling/disabling gateways, updating non-sensitive parameters). Highly sensitive credentials should not be managed via these APIs.

## General API Design Principles:

*   **RESTful Conventions**: Follow RESTful design principles where appropriate (e.g., use of HTTP verbs, status codes).
*   **Statelessness**: APIs should be stateless.
*   **Idempotency**: Critical operations like payment creation or refund initiation should support idempotency (e.g., via an `Idempotency-Key` header).
*   **Authentication & Authorization**: All endpoints must be protected. JWT-based authentication is common. Authorization rules will vary (user-specific access, admin roles).
*   **Input Validation**: Rigorous input validation for all request parameters and payloads.
*   **Standardized Error Responses**: Consistent error response format.
*   **Versioning**: API versioning strategy (e.g., URI versioning `/v1/payments/...`) to manage changes.
*   **Pagination**: For list endpoints, use pagination (e.g., `limit` and `offset` or cursor-based).

## OpenAPI Specification:

*   An OpenAPI (Swagger) specification will be maintained in the `openapi/` subdirectory (e.g., `openapi/payment-service-v1.yaml`). This specification will provide a detailed, machine-readable definition of all endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication mechanisms.

These endpoints provide the interface for interacting with the Payment Service's capabilities, forming a crucial part of the e-commerce platform's financial operations.

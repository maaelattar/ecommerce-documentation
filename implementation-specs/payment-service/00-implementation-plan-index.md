    *   Core principles (security, reliability, compliance).

2.  **[02-data-model-setup/](./02-data-model-setup/)**
    *   `00-overview.md`: Overview of key data entities.
    *   Detailed schema for each entity (e.g., Payment, Transaction, PaymentMethod, Refund, CustomerGatewayToken).
    *   Database technology selection (e.g., PostgreSQL).

        *   SecurityAndComplianceService

4.  **[04-api-endpoints/](./04-api-endpoints/)**
    *   `00-overview.md`: Overview of API endpoint categories.
    *   Detailed specifications for endpoints related to:
        *   Payment Initiation (e.g., Create Payment Intent, Process Payment)
        *   Payment Method Management (e.g., Add, List, Delete Payment Method)
        *   Refund Processing
        *   Transaction History
        *   Webhook Handling (from payment gateways)
    *   `openapi/`: OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for the service.

5.  **[05-event-publishing/](./05-event-publishing/)**
    *   `00-overview.md`: Overview of event publishing strategy.
    *   Key events published by the Payment Service (e.g., PaymentSucceeded, PaymentFailed, RefundProcessed, PaymentMethodAdded).
    *   Event naming conventions and Kafka topics (e.g., `payment.events`).
    *   Event payloads and data minimization.
    *   Idempotency and error handling in event publishing.
    *   Schema management and versioning for events.

6.  **[06-integration-points/](./06-integration-points/)**
    *   `00-overview.md`: Overview of integration types.
    *   **Internal Integrations**:
        *   Order Service (consuming payment status updates, initiating refunds).
        *   User Service (linking payment methods to users, potentially for customer data).
        *   Notification Service (for sending payment confirmations, refund notifications).
    *   **External Integrations**:
        *   Payment Gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Adyen) - critical integration.
        *   Fraud Detection Services (if external).
        *   Tax Calculation Services.
        *   Banking/Settlement Systems (potentially).
    *   Security considerations for each integration.

7.  **[07-security-and-compliance/](./07-security-and-compliance/)**
    *   `00-overview.md`: Overview of security and compliance measures.
    *   PCI DSS Compliance (critical for payment processing).
    *   Data encryption (at rest, in transit, especially for sensitive payment data).
    *   Tokenization of payment information.
    *   Secure handling of API keys and credentials for payment gateways.
    *   Audit logging for all payment-related operations.
    *   Fraud prevention mechanisms.
    *   Data privacy considerations (GDPR, CCPA).

8.  **[08-deployment-operations/](./08-deployment-operations/)**
    *   `00-overview.md`: Overview of deployment and operational aspects.
    *   Deployment strategy (Containerization, Kubernetes).
    *   Infrastructure requirements (specific to payment processing needs).
    *   Configuration management (handling sensitive gateway keys securely).
    *   Monitoring and alerting (key metrics for payment success rates, gateway errors, transaction times).
    *   Scalability and performance (handling peak transaction loads).
    *   Backup and disaster recovery (critical for financial data).
    *   Maintenance, upgrades, and PCI compliance validation.

This plan will guide the development and documentation of the Payment Service.

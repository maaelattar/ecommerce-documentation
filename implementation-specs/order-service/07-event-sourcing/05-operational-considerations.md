### Alerting Thresholds

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Action |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Order creation latency (p95) | > 2s | > 5s | Investigate potential bottlenecks |
| Order read latency (p95) | > 500ms | > 1s | Check snapshot strategy, DynamoDB capacity |

| Snapshot hit ratio | < 80% | < 50% | Review snapshot strategy |

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization

1. **DynamoDB Capacity Planning**
   - Use on-demand capacity for unpredictable order volumes (e.g., flash sales)
   - Use provisioned capacity with auto-scaling for predictable workloads
   - Set up scheduled scaling for anticipated busy periods (holidays, promotions)
   - Consider reserved capacity for cost optimization on baseline workload

2. **Access Patterns**
   - Optimize partition key distribution to avoid hot partitions
   - Use composite sort keys to enable efficient range queries
   - Implement sparse indexes for frequently filtered queries
   - Use batch operations for bulk reads/writes

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Use eventually consistent reads for non-critical order views
   - Implement pagination for lists of orders
   - Cache frequently accessed order projections
   - Use projection expressions to retrieve only needed attributes

### Event Processing Optimization

1. **Batched Event Processing**
   - Process events in batches for bulk operations
   - Use DynamoDB transactions for atomic operations

2. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Use Lambda functions for event handling that doesn't need immediate consistency
   - Implement backpressure mechanisms for handling traffic spikes

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache order data with appropriate TTL
   - Implement cache invalidation on order updates
   - Use multi-level caching (memory + Redis) for high-volume orders

## Backup and Recovery Strategies

### Event Store Backup

1. **Point-in-Time Recovery**
   - Enable point-in-time recovery on DynamoDB tables
   - Allows restoration to any point within the last 35 days

2. **Scheduled Backups**
   - Configure AWS Backup for daily order_events table backups
   - Implement retention policies:
     - Daily backups retained for 30 days
     - Weekly backups retained for 90 days
     - Monthly backups retained for 1 year

3. **Event Replication**
   - Stream events to S3 using DynamoDB Streams and Lambda
   - Use S3 lifecycle policies for long-term archival
   - Implement cross-region replication for disaster recovery

### Snapshot Store Backup

1. **Regular Snapshots**
   - Back up the snapshot table on the same schedule as the event store
   - Maintain consistency between snapshot and event store backups

2. **Recovery Testing**
   - Regularly test the recovery process in a staging environment
   - Validate that restored snapshots match expected order state

### Recovery Procedures

#### Full System Recovery

The process for full system recovery:

1. **Service Deployment**
   - Deploy Order Service infrastructure and code

2. **Database Restoration**
   - Restore order_events and order_snapshots tables from backups

3. **Validation**
   - Run consistency checks on restored data
   - Verify event sequence integrity

4. **Order Reconstruction**
   - Test order reconstruction for a sample of orders
   - Verify that business rules are maintained

5. **Service Resumption**
   - Gradually route traffic to restored service
   - Monitor for anomalies during ramp-up

#### Partial Recovery (Single Order)

For recovering specific orders:

1. **Backup Inspection**
   - Identify the latest backup containing the order events

2. **Event Extraction**
   - Extract relevant events for the specific order

3. **Order Reconstruction**
   - Rebuild the order from extracted events
   - Validate business rules consistency

4. **State Correction**
   - Apply any necessary corrections
   - Create a new snapshot of the corrected state

## Disaster Recovery Plan

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

The Order Service implements tiered RTOs based on the criticality of operations:

1. **Tier 1 - Critical Operations (RTO: 15 minutes)**
   - Order status lookup
   - Payment acceptance

2. **Tier 2 - Important Operations (RTO: 1 hour)**
   - Order creation
   - Order updates

3. **Tier 3 - Non-critical Operations (RTO: 4 hours)**
   - Historical order views
   - Reporting functionality

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

The maximum acceptable data loss:

1. **Tier 1 - Critical Data (RPO: 0 - 5 minutes)**
   - Order payment confirmations
   - Order status changes

2. **Tier 2 - Important Data (RPO: 15 minutes)**
   - Order creation
   - Order details updates

3. **Tier 3 - Non-critical Data (RPO: 1 hour)**
   - Analytics data
   - Historical aggregations

### Disaster Scenarios and Responses

1. **DynamoDB Table Corruption**
   - Restore from point-in-time backup
   - Replay any missing events from SNS/SQS dead letter queues

2. **Availability Zone Failure**
   - Automatically fail over to replicas in other AZs
   - Use global tables for cross-region resilience

3. **Region Failure**
   - Switch to standby region using Route 53 routing policies
   - Promote replicated events and snapshots to primary

4. **Application Logic Error**
   - Deploy fixed code
   - Use event replay functionality to correct affected orders

## Handling Schema Evolution

### Event Schema Versioning

The Order Service implements a formal event schema versioning strategy:

```typescript
export interface EventSchemaVersion {
  version: number;
  deprecated: boolean;
  schema: any; // JSON Schema
  migrationFunction?: (oldEvent: any) => any;
}

export const ORDER_CREATED_SCHEMA_VERSIONS: Record<number, EventSchemaVersion> = {
  1: {
    version: 1,
    deprecated: true,
    schema: { /* original schema */ }
  },
  2: {
    version: 2,
    deprecated: false,
    schema: { /* current schema with additional fields */ },
    migrationFunction: (oldEvent) => {
      // Convert from V1 to V2
      return {
        ...oldEvent,
        // Add new fields or transform existing ones
        newField: 'defaultValue'
      };
    }
  }
};
```

### Schema Migration Strategy

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Always maintain backward compatibility for at least one version
   - Include version number in each event
   - Never remove fields, only add new optional fields

2. **Event Upcasting**
   - Implement event upcasters to convert events on read
   - Use a chain of responsibility pattern for multiple version migrations

3. **Schema Registry**
   - Maintain a schema registry for all event types
   - Validate events against schemas before persistence

4. **Deprecation Policy**
   - Mark schemas as deprecated before removal
   - Provide ample migration time before retiring old schemas

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Resolutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Troubleshooting Steps | Resolution |
|-------|----------|----------------------|------------|
| Slow order reads | High latency on order page | Check snapshot hit ratio, event count per order | Adjust snapshot strategy, increase caching |
| Event persistence failures | Failed order operations, error logs | Check DynamoDB capacity, network connectivity | Increase capacity, restore connectivity |
| Concurrency conflicts | Optimistic locking exceptions | Identify high-contention orders | Implement backoff strategy, review business logic |
| Projection inconsistency | Order views show incorrect data | Check event processing logs | Rebuild projections from events |
| Event publication failures | Missing events in downstream systems | Check SNS logs, delivery status | Republish events, check connectivity |

### Debugging Tools

1. **Event Store Explorer**
   - A web-based UI for browsing and searching order events
   - Filtering by time range, event type, and order ID
   - Visualization of event sequences

2. **Order State Debugger**
   - Tool to compare current order state with expected state
   - Ability to replay events step-by-step
   - Visualization of state changes after each event

3. **Log Analysis**
   - Centralized logging with correlation IDs
   - Log search and filtering by order ID, event type, and timestamp
   - Alert correlation and root cause analysis

## Capacity Planning

### Sizing Guidelines

| Metric | Small | Medium | Large |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Orders per day | < 1,000 | 1,000-10,000 | > 10,000 |

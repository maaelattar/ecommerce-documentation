# Inventory Service Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document serves as the master plan and index for implementing the **Inventory Service**. This service is critical for managing stock levels and ensuring data accuracy across the e-commerce platform.

The Inventory Service is responsible for tracking product inventory, managing stock adjustments, and providing real-time inventory data to other services like the Product Service and Order Service. It will expose an API for inventory operations and publish domain events for inventory changes.

## 2. Implementation Increments (Phased Approach)

We've broken down the implementation into distinct incremental phases, each of which can be implemented as a separate ticket. Each phase has its own detailed specification document.

### Phase 1: Repository Setup and Project Scaffolding
- [Specification Document: 01-repository-setup.md](./01-repository-setup.md)
- **Objective**: Create and configure the Git repository with basic NestJS structure for the Inventory Service.
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Initialized Git repository for Inventory Service
  - Basic NestJS application with TypeScript setup
  - `.gitignore`, `README.md`
  - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

### Phase 2: Data Model and Database Setup
- [Specification Document: 02-data-model-setup.md](./02-data-model-setup.md) (incorporating [01-inventory-entity.md](./02-data-model-setup/01-inventory-entity.md))
- **Objective**: Define the inventory data model and set up database connections.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Database selection implementation (PostgreSQL via RDS)
  - Entity definitions for Inventory (referencing `01-inventory-entity.md`)
  - TypeORM configuration
  - Database migration scripts

### Phase 3: Core Service Components
- [Specification Document: 03-core-service-components.md](./03-core-service-components.md)
- **Objective**: Implement the core business logic components for inventory management.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Stock Management Component (adjustments, reservations)
  - Inventory Tracking Component
  - Data Persistence Component

### Phase 4: API Layer
- [Specification Document: 04-api-layer.md](./04-api-layer.md) (incorporating [01-inventory-api.md](./04-api-endpoints/01-inventory-api.md) and referencing [openapi/inventory-service.yaml](../../openapi/inventory-service.yaml))
- **Objective**: Build the REST API interface for the service.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - API Controllers (REST endpoints as defined in `01-inventory-api.md`)
  - DTO definitions
  - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation (based on `openapi/inventory-service.yaml`)
  - Validation and error handling

### Phase 5: Event Publishing
- [Specification Document: 05-event-publishing.md](./05-event-publishing.md)
- **Objective**: Implement event publishing for domain events related to inventory changes.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Event definitions (e.g., StockUpdated, StockReserved, OutOfStock)
  - Integration with Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ
  - Event publishing service

### Phase 6: Integration with Other Services
- [Specification Document: 06-integration-points.md](./06-integration-points.md)
- **Objective**: Define and implement integration patterns with other microservices.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Asynchronous event-driven integration (primary approach)
  - Integration with Product Service (consuming product creation/updates)
  - Integration with Order Service (inventory reservation and deduction)
  - API consumption guidelines for justified synchronous calls

### Phase 7: Testing and CI/CD Setup
- [Specification Document: 07-testing-cicd.md](./07-testing-cicd.md)
- **Objective**: Establish comprehensive testing and automation for the Inventory Service.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Unit and integration tests
  - CI/CD pipeline configuration
  - Test data and scenarios for inventory operations

### Phase 8: Production Readiness
- [Specification Document: 08-production-readiness.md](./08-production-readiness.md)
- **Objective**: Finalize the Inventory Service for production deployment.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Monitoring and logging setup
  - Health check endpoints
  - Documentation finalization
  - Performance optimizations for high-traffic inventory updates

## 3. Technical Decisions Summary

The implementation is guided by these key technical decisions from our documentation:

1.  **Language and Framework**: Node.js with NestJS (as indicated in the C3 diagrams and ADR-003)
2.  **Database**:
    *   Primary database: PostgreSQL via Amazon RDS (as per ADR-004, ADR-020)
3.  **Messaging**: RabbitMQ via Amazon MQ for event publishing (as per ADR-002)
4.  **API Gateway**: Amazon API Gateway for API exposure (as per ADR-006)
5.  **Architecture Pattern**: 
    *   Event-Driven Architecture (as per ADR-002)
    *   API-First Design (as per ADR-007)
    *   Database-per-Service (as per ADR-020)

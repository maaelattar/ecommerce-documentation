# Database Selection for Inventory Service

## Requirements

The Inventory Service requires a database solution that can:
- Support high-volume transactional processing
- Maintain data integrity for inventory records
- Scale horizontally to handle growing product catalog
- Support event sourcing pattern
- Provide good query performance for inventory lookups
- Ensure consistency for inventory allocations

## Selected Database: PostgreSQL + DynamoDB

### Primary Database: PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL will serve as the primary operational database for the Inventory Service, storing:
- Current inventory state
- Warehouse information
- Allocation records
- Stock transactions

#### Justification:
- ACID compliance ensures data integrity for critical inventory operations
- Strong support for complex queries and reporting
- Mature and well-understood by the development team
- Consistent with other services in our architecture

### Event Store: DynamoDB
DynamoDB will be used as the event store for implementing the event sourcing pattern:
- All inventory events will be stored chronologically
- Enables complete audit trail of inventory changes
- Allows for event replay and system reconstruction

#### Justification:
- Scalable NoSQL solution for high-volume event storage
- Low-latency writes for event capture
- Cost-effective for append-only event records
- AWS-native solution that integrates well with our infrastructure

## Schema Strategy

### PostgreSQL Schema
- Normalized schema for operational data
- Foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity
- Optimized indexes for common query patterns
- Partitioning strategy for high-volume tables

### DynamoDB Schema
- Simple key-value schema for event storage
- Partition key: Entity ID (e.g., InventoryItemId)
- Sort key: Timestamp or sequence number
- TTL for event archiving strategy

## Migration and Backup Strategy
- Regular backups using AWS RDS automated backup for PostgreSQL
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- DynamoDB continuous backups with point-in-time recovery
- Database migration strategy using versioned schema changes

## Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling for PostgreSQL access
- Read replicas for reporting queries
- Caching layer for frequently accessed inventory data
- DynamoDB auto-scaling for handling event storage peaks

# Inventory Service Implementation Plan

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The Inventory Service is a critical component of our e-commerce platform responsible for tracking stock levels, managing warehouse locations, handling inventory allocations, and ensuring accurate inventory across the entire supply chain. This implementation plan outlines the approach, architecture, and phased delivery of the Inventory Service.

### 1.2 Business Drivers
- Enable real-time inventory visibility across all sales channels
- Prevent overselling through accurate allocation management
- Provide audit trails for all inventory movements
- Support multi-warehouse inventory management
- Enable automated reordering based on inventory thresholds
- Facilitate accurate fulfillment operations

### 1.3 Architectural Approach
The Inventory Service follows:
- Microservice architecture with clear domain boundaries
- Event Sourcing pattern for complete inventory history
- Event-Driven Architecture for loose coupling with other services
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for optimized read/write operations
- Domain-Driven Design principles for business alignment

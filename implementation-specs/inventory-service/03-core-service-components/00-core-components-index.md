# Inventory Service Core Components

## Overview

The Inventory Service is built on a foundation of core components that handle inventory management, allocation, and stock tracking operations. These components follow the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern and implement event sourcing for audit and reliability.

## Component Architecture

The service follows a layered architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Controllers   │ ← HTTP/API layer
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│    Services     │ ← Business logic coordination
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│    Commands     │ ← Command processing
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│   Repositories  │ ← Data access
└─────────────────┘
```

## Core Components

### 1. Inventory Management
Responsible for core inventory operations like adding, updating, and tracking stock levels.
- [Inventory Management Service](./01-inventory-management-service.md)

### 2. Allocation Management
Handles the reservation and allocation of inventory for orders.
- [Allocation Management Service](./02-allocation-management-service.md)

### 3. Stock Transaction Processor
Processes and records all inventory movements.
- [Stock Transaction Processor](./03-stock-transaction-processor.md)

### 4. Warehouse Management
Manages warehouse information and operations.
- [Warehouse Management Service](./04-warehouse-management-service.md)

### 5. Inventory Event Publisher
Publishes domain events related to inventory changes.
- [Inventory Event Publisher](./05-inventory-event-publisher.md)

### 6. Query Services
Read-only services for retrieving inventory information.
- [Inventory Query Service](./06-inventory-query-service.md)

## CQRS Implementation

The service implements CQRS by separating commands (write operations) from queries (read operations):

### Command Side
- Accepts commands to modify inventory state
- Validates business rules
- Updates the data store
- Publishes events

### Query Side
- Provides optimized read models
- Supports various query patterns
- Consumes events to update projections
- Does not modify state

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

1. **Logging**
   - Structured logging using Winston
   - Request correlation IDs
   - Log levels for different environments

2. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error response format
   - Error classification (validation, business rule, system)
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures

3. **Monitoring**
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Custom business metrics (stock outs, allocation failures)
   - Health check endpoints

4. **Security**
   - Authentication via JWT
   - Role-based access control
   - Input validation

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstracts data access details
   - Supports unit testing through mocking

2. **Command Pattern**
   - Encapsulates operations as objects
   - Enables features like validation, logging, and retries

3. **Factory Pattern**
   - Creates complex objects or object graphs
   - Centralizes creation logic

4. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Allows swapping allocation algorithms
   - Enables flexible configuration

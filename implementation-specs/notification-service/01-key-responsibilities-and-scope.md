# Notification Service - Key Responsibilities and Scope

## 1. Overview

The Notification Service is a centralized component responsible for managing and dispatching all outbound communications to users of the e-commerce platform. It acts as a gateway for various notification channels, ensuring consistent, reliable, and preference-aware communication.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

*   **Multi-Channel Dispatch**: Capable of sending notifications via multiple channels, including but not limited to:
    *   Email (e.g., order confirmations, shipping updates, password resets, marketing)
    *   SMS (e.g., OTPs, critical alerts, delivery notifications)
    *   Push Notifications (for mobile applications, e.g., special offers, order status changes)
    *   (Potentially) Webhooks to external systems.
*   **Template Management**: Manages a repository of notification templates for various communication scenarios. This allows for consistent branding, localization, and easier updates to notification content without code changes in other services.
*   **Event Consumption**: Listens to domain events published by other microservices (e.g., Order Service, User Service, Payment Service) to trigger appropriate notifications.
*   **Recipient Preference Management**: Stores and respects user communication preferences (e.g., opt-in/opt-out for marketing emails, preferred notification channels for certain event types).
*   **Dispatch Scheduling & Throttling**: Capable of scheduling notifications for later delivery and throttling dispatch rates to comply with provider limits or to avoid overwhelming users.
*   **Status Tracking & Auditing**: Tracks the status of dispatched notifications (e.g., sent, delivered, failed, bounced, opened, clicked) and provides an audit trail for all communications.
*   **Retry Mechanisms**: Implements retry logic for transient failures in dispatching notifications to external providers.
*   **Error Handling & Reporting**: Manages errors during notification generation or dispatch and provides mechanisms for reporting significant failures.
*   **Short URL / Link Tracking**: (Potentially) Integrates with a URL shortening and link tracking service for notifications containing links.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1. In Scope

*   Receiving notification requests (typically via consuming events, but potentially via a direct API for specific use cases like admin-triggered notifications).
*   Validating notification requests and required parameters.
*   Selecting the appropriate template based on the event type, recipient, and context.
*   Personalizing notification content using dynamic data from the triggering event or user profile.
*   Checking user communication preferences and consent before dispatching.
*   Interacting with various third-party notification provider gateways (e.g., AWS SES for email, Twilio/SNS for SMS, Firebase Cloud Messaging/APNS for push).
*   Managing API keys and credentials for these external providers securely.
*   Handling delivery status callbacks/webhooks from providers.
*   Storing notification history and logs.
*   Publishing events about its own operations (e.g., `NotificationSentEvent`, `NotificationFailedEvent`, `NotificationDeliveryUpdateEvent`).

### 3.2. Out of Scope

*   **Determining *when* a notification should be sent**: This logic resides in the domain services. For example, the Order Service decides an order confirmation email is needed; the Notification Service merely sends it.
*   **Generating the primary business data/content**: The Notification Service uses data provided in the triggering event or fetched from other services (via API calls, if necessary, though event-carried state is preferred) to populate templates. It does not create this business data itself.
*   **User Interface for Managing Preferences**: While it stores and enforces preferences, the UI for users to manage their preferences will likely reside in the User Service or a dedicated frontend application (which would then call APIs on the User Service or Notification Service to update settings).
*   **Complex Real-time User Interaction/Chat**: This service is for asynchronous notifications, not real-time chat or support systems.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) / Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Reliability**: High success rate for notification delivery.
*   **Scalability**: Ability to handle peak loads of notification requests (e.g., during promotional events).
*   **Latency**: Timely dispatch of notifications, especially for time-sensitive alerts (e.g., OTPs).
*   **Deliverability**: Measures to ensure good sender reputation and avoid spam filters.
*   **Configurability**: Easy to add new notification types, channels, and templates.
*   **Auditability**: Comprehensive logging of all notification activities.

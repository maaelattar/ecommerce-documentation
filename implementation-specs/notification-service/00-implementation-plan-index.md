# Notification Service Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document serves as the master plan and index for implementing the **Notification Service**. This service is responsible for managing and dispatching all outgoing communications to users, such as emails, SMS messages, and potentially push notifications. It will act as a centralized hub for notifications, triggered by events from other microservices within the e-commerce platform.

The Notification Service will primarily consume events from the message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ via Amazon MQ, as per **ADR-018**), process them based on user preferences and notification templates, and then integrate with various third-party services (e.g., SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS, AWS SNS for push notifications) to deliver the actual notifications. It may also expose a minimal API for configuration, status checks, or template management. The service will likely be built using Node.js and NestJS, adhering to **ADR-003**.

## 2. Implementation Increments (Phased Approach)

The implementation is broken down into distinct incremental phases. Each phase will have its own detailed specification document.

### Phase 1: Repository Setup and Project Scaffolding
- [Specification Document: 01-repository-setup.md](./01-repository-setup.md)
- **Objective**: Create and configure the Git repository with a basic NestJS structure for the Notification Service.
- **Key Deliverables**: Initialized Git repository, basic NestJS application, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, Dockerfile.

### Phase 2: Data Model and Database Setup
- [Specification Document: 02-data-model-setup.md](./02-data-model-setup.md)
- **Objective**: Define the data model for storing notification history, templates, user notification preferences, and channel configurations. Set up database connections if required (e.g., PostgreSQL as per **ADR-004**).
- **Key Deliverables**: Entity definitions (NotificationLog, NotificationTemplate, UserPreferences), TypeORM configuration (if applicable), migration scripts.

### Phase 3: Core Service Components
- [Specification Document: 03-core-service-components.md](./03-core-service-components.md)
- **Objective**: Implement the core business logic components for processing notification requests and managing templates.
- **Key Deliverables**: Notification Dispatcher/Orchestrator, Template Rendering Engine, Preference Manager.

### Phase 4: API Layer
- [Specification Document: 04-api-layer.md](./04-api-layer.md)
- **Objective**: Design and build a REST API interface if necessary for managing notification templates, configurations, or viewing notification status/history.
- **Key Deliverables**: API Controllers (REST endpoints), DTO definitions, validation, error handling.

### Phase 5: Event Consumption
- [Specification Document: 05-event-consumption.md](./05-event-consumption.md)
- **Objective**: Implement event consumption from the message broker to trigger notifications based on domain events from other services (e.g., OrderConfirmed, ShipmentDispatched, PasswordResetRequested).
- **Key Deliverables**: Event listener modules, event DTOs, mapping logic from events to notification types.

### Phase 6: Channel Integrations
- [Specification Document: 06-channel-integrations.md](./06-channel-integrations.md)
- **Objective**: Integrate with external notification delivery services for various channels.
- **Key Deliverables**:
    - Email channel integration (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES).
    - SMS channel integration (e.g., Twilio, AWS SNS).
    - Push notification channel integration (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Apple Push Notification service (APNs), AWS SNS).

### Phase 7: Testing and CI/CD Setup
- [Specification Document: 07-testing-cicd.md](./07-testing-cicd.md)
- **Objective**: Establish comprehensive testing (unit, integration, contract tests for events) and a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Key Deliverables**: Test suites, CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions).

### Phase 8: Production Readiness
- [Specification Document: 08-production-readiness.md](./08-production-readiness.md)
- **Objective**: Ensure the service is ready for production deployment, including monitoring, logging, scalability, and security measures.
- **Key Deliverables**: Monitoring dashboards, alert configurations, logging setup, security hardening.

### Phase 9: Template Management
- [Specification Document: 09-template-management.md](./09-template-management.md)
- **Objective**: Develop a robust system for creating, storing, versioning, and rendering notification templates for different channels and locales.
- **Key Deliverables**: Template storage solution (database or file-based), template rendering logic, API for template management (if applicable).

### Phase 10: OpenAPI Specification
- [Specification Document: 10-openapi-specification.md](./10-openapi-specification.md)
- **Objective**: Create a comprehensive OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for the Notification Service API (if an API layer is implemented in Phase 4).
- **Key Deliverables**: `openapi.yaml` file defining all API endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication methods.

## 3. Technical Decisions Summary

The implementation will be guided by key technical decisions from our architectural documentation:

1.  **Primary Communication Style**: Event-Driven (as per **ADR-002: Event-Driven Architecture**).
2.  **Language and Framework**: Node.js with NestJS (as per **ADR-003: Node.js/NestJS Technology Stack**).
3.  **Database (if needed for logs/templates/preferences)**: PostgreSQL via Amazon RDS (as per **ADR-004: Database Selection** and **ADR-020: Database-per-Service**).
4.  **API Design (if API layer is implemented)**: API-First Design principles (as per **ADR-007: API-First Design**).
5.  **Messaging Broker**: RabbitMQ via Amazon MQ (as per **ADR-018: Message Broker Strategy**).
6.  **Configuration Management**: Externalized configuration (as per **ADR-016: Configuration Management**).
7.  **Authentication & Authorization (for API, if any)**: (as per **ADR-005: Authentication and Authorization**).

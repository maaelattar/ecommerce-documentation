# Product Service Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document serves as the master plan and index for implementing the **Product Service** - the first microservice in our e-commerce platform as determined by our [service dependency analysis](../../architecture/service-dependency-analysis.md).

The Product Service is responsible for managing all product-related information, including product details, categories, pricing, inventory levels, and integrating with the search capabilities. It will expose an API for product operations and publish domain events for other services to consume.

## 2. Implementation Increments (Phased Approach)

We've broken down the implementation into distinct incremental phases, each of which can be implemented as a separate ticket. Each phase has its own detailed specification document.

### Phase 1: Repository Setup and Project Scaffolding
- [Specification Document: 01-repository-setup.md](./01-repository-setup.md)
- **Objective**: Create and configure the Git repository with basic NestJS structure
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Initialized Git repository
  - Basic NestJS application with TypeScript setup
  - `.gitignore`, `README.md`
  - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

### Phase 2: Data Model and Database Setup
- [Specification Document: 02-data-model-setup.md](./02-data-model-setup.md)
- **Objective**: Define the product data model and set up database connections
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Database selection implementation (PostgreSQL via RDS)
  - Entity definitions for Product, Category, Price
  - TypeORM configuration
  - Database migration scripts

### Phase 3: Core Service Components
- [Specification Document: 03-core-service-components.md](./03-core-service-components.md)
- **Objective**: Implement the core business logic components
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Product Catalog Component
  - Pricing Component
  - Data Persistence Component

### Phase 4: API Layer
- [Specification Document: 04-api-layer.md](./04-api-layer.md)
- **Objective**: Build the REST API interface for the service
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - API Controllers (REST endpoints)
  - DTO definitions
  - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
  - Validation and error handling
  - Integration points with other services (e.g., Inventory Service, User Service)

### Phase 5: Event Publishing
- [Specification Document: 05-event-publishing.md](./05-event-publishing.md)
- **Objective**: Implement event publishing for domain events
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Event definitions
  - Integration with Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ
  - Event publishing service
  - Architecture Pattern: 
   - Event-Driven Architecture (as per ADR-002)
   - API-First Design (as per ADR-007)
   - Database-per-Service (as per ADR-020)
   - Integration with dedicated services like Inventory Service, Notification Service, etc.

### Phase 6: Integration with Other Services
- [Specification Document: 06-integration-points/00-overview.md](./06-integration-points/00-overview.md)
- **Objective**: Define and implement integration patterns with other microservices
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Asynchronous event-driven integration (primary approach)
  - Integration with Inventory Service
  - Integration with Order Service
  - Integration with User Service
  - Integration with Review Service
  - Integration with Notification Service
  - Integration with Search Service using Amazon OpenSearch Service
  - API consumption guidelines for justified synchronous calls
  - Exposing Product Service APIs to other services



### Phase 7: Event Sourcing Implementation
- [Specification Document: 07-event-sourcing/00-overview.md](./07-event-sourcing/00-overview.md)
- **Objective**: Implement event sourcing for the Product Service
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Event store based on DynamoDB
  - Domain events for all product state changes
  - Command handlers and projections
  - CQRS pattern implementation
  - API integration with event sourcing

### Phase 8: Testing and CI/CD Setup
- [Specification Document: 08-testing-cicd.md](./08-testing-cicd.md) 
- **Objective**: Establish comprehensive testing and automation
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Unit and integration tests
  - CI/CD pipeline configuration
  - Test data and scenarios

### Phase 9: Production Readiness
- [Specification Document: 09-production-readiness.md](./09-production-readiness.md)
- **Objective**: Finalize for production deployment
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Monitoring and logging setup
  - Health check endpoints
  - Documentation finalization
  - Performance optimizations

## 3. Technical Decisions Summary

The implementation is guided by these key technical decisions from our documentation:

1. **Language and Framework**: Node.js with NestJS (as indicated in the C3 diagrams)
2. **Database**:
   - Primary database: PostgreSQL via Amazon RDS
   - Event Store: Amazon DynamoDB
   - Projections: PostgreSQL via Amazon RDS
3. **Messaging**: RabbitMQ via Amazon MQ for event publishing
4. **API Gateway**: Amazon API Gateway for API exposure
5. **Search**: Amazon OpenSearch Service for product indexing
6. **Architecture Pattern**: 
   - Event-Driven Architecture (as per ADR-002)
   - API-First Design (as per ADR-007)
   - Database-per-Service (as per ADR-020)
   - Event Sourcing and CQRS (as per EDA Standards)
   - Asynchronous Communication (as per EDA Standards)

# Testing Strategy Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Product Service core components, including unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. It covers test data management, automation, coverage goals, performance, security, and best practices to ensure high quality and reliability.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test individual service methods in isolation
- Mock dependencies (repositories, external services)
- Cover business rules, validation, and error scenarios
- **Example:**
  - Test product creation with valid/invalid data
  - Test category hierarchy validation
  - Test inventory reservation logic

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test workflows involving multiple services/components
- Validate event publishing and consumption
- Test database interactions and transactional integrity
- **Example:**
  - Test product creation with inventory and price initialization
  - Test category move with product associations
  - Test order creation triggering inventory reservation

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- Test API endpoints for all core services (product, category, inventory, price/discount)
- Simulate real user scenarios and workflows
- Validate security, authentication, and authorization
- **Example:**
  - Create product via API, verify in database and search index
  - Place order, verify inventory and order status

## Test Data Management
- Use test factories for creating products, categories, variants, inventory, prices, and discounts
- Seed and clean up test data before/after tests
- Use in-memory or dedicated test databases
- **Best Practices:**
  - Isolate test data per test run
  - Use fixtures for complex scenarios

## Test Automation
- Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Run tests on every pull request and main branch push
- Generate and publish test reports (JUnit, coverage)
- Block merges on test failures or low coverage

## Coverage Goals
- Aim for >90% coverage on service logic
- Cover all critical paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Use coverage tools (e.g., Jest, Istanbul)
- **Best Practices:**
  - Review coverage reports regularly
  - Focus on business-critical and security-sensitive code

## Performance Testing
- Load and stress test core service APIs
- Measure response times, throughput, and resource usage
- Identify and address bottlenecks
- **Example:**
  - Simulate 1000 concurrent product queries
  - Bulk import products and measure processing time

## Security Testing
- Test input validation and sanitization
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Test for common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Use static analysis and dynamic scanning tools
- **Example:**
  - Attempt SQL injection on product search
  - Test unauthorized access to admin endpoints

## Best Practices
- Organize tests by feature and service
- Use descriptive test names and AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Keep tests independent and repeatable
- Clean up test data after each run
- Mock external dependencies where possible
- Review and update tests as features evolve

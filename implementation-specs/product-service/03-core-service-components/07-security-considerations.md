# Security Considerations Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations for the Product Service core components, including authentication, authorization, data protection, audit logging, input validation, API security, and monitoring.

## Authentication
- Use JWT or OAuth2 for all API endpoints
- Validate tokens on every request
- Support token expiration and refresh
- **Flow Example:**
  1. User logs in and receives JWT
  2. JWT is included in Authorization header for all requests
  3. Service validates JWT signature and claims

## Authorization
- Enforce RBAC for all service operations (admin, manager, editor, warehouse, marketing roles)
- Resource-based access for sensitive operations (e.g., product ownership)
- Regularly review and update permissions
- **RBAC Matrix Example:**

| Role      | Create | Update | Delete | View | Approve | Manage Inventory |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|------|---------|------------------|
| Admin     |   ✓    |   ✓    |   ✓    |  ✓   |    ✓    |        ✓         |
| Manager   |   ✓    |   ✓    |   ✓    |  ✓   |    ✓    |        ✓         |
| Editor    |   ✓    |   ✓    |        |  ✓   |         |                  |
| Warehouse |        |        |        |  ✓   |         |        ✓         |
| Marketing |        |        |        |  ✓   |         |                  |

## Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (TLS/SSL)
- Mask or encrypt sensitive fields in logs and responses
- Use environment variables for secrets and credentials
- **Example:**
  - Use PostgreSQL SSL connections
  - Store secrets in a vault or secret manager

## Audit Logging
- Log all create, update, delete, and status change operations
- Include user context, timestamps, and before/after state
- Store logs securely and monitor for suspicious activity
- **Audit Log Structure Example:**
```json
{
  "action": "UPDATE",
  "entity": "Product",
  "entityId": "uuid",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "before": { /* previous state */ },
  "after": { /* new state */ }
}
```

## Input Validation & Sanitization
- Use DTOs and class-validator for all input
- Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks
- Enforce strict data types and value ranges
- **Example:**
```typescript
@IsString()
@MaxLength(255)
name: string;
```

## API Security
- Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Set CORS and security headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy)
- Validate and sanitize all incoming requests
- Use HTTPS for all external communication
- **Example Security Headers:**
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

## Monitoring & Incident Response
- Monitor authentication failures, access violations, and suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for security incidents
- Regularly review and test incident response procedures
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use SIEM tools for log aggregation and analysis
  - Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests

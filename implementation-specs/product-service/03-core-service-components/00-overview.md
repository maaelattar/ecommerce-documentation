# Core Service Components Implementation Overview

## Phase Objectives

This phase focuses on implementing the core service components for the Product Service. The main objectives are:

1. Develop business logic for product, category, inventory, and price/discount management
2. Implement service orchestration and workflows
3. Integrate with repositories and external services
4. Ensure robust error handling, validation, and security
5. Provide comprehensive testing and documentation

## Implementation Components

The implementation is organized into the following components:

1. [Product Service](01-product-service.md)
   - Business logic for product management
   - Service methods and orchestration
   - Integration with repositories

2. [Category Service](02-category-service.md)
   - Category management workflows
   - Hierarchy operations
   - Integration with product service

3. [Inventory Service](03-inventory-service.md)
   - Inventory management logic
   - Stock updates and reservations
   - Integration with order service

4. [Price & Discount Service](04-price-discount-service.md)
   - Price calculation and updates
   - Discount application workflows
   - Integration with product and inventory services

5. [Integration Points](05-integration-points.md)
   - Communication with other microservices (order, user, notification)
   - Event-driven patterns and message brokers

6. [Testing Strategy](06-testing-strategy.md)
   - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
   - Test data and coverage

7. [Security Considerations](07-security-considerations.md)
   - Access control and authorization
   - Data protection and audit logging

8. [Non-Functional Requirements](08-non-functional-requirements.md)
   - Performance, scalability, reliability, maintainability

## Dependencies

- Completion of Phase 2: Data Model and Database Setup
- Implemented repositories and database migrations
- Access to external services for integration

## Key Technical Decisions

- Service boundaries and responsibilities
- Orchestration vs. choreography for workflows
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Security and access control patterns

## Next Steps

After implementing the core service components, the next phase will focus on:

1. API endpoints and controllers
2. API documentation and validation
3. Integration and system testing
4. Deployment and monitoring

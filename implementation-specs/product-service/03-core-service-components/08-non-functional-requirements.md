# Non-Functional Requirements Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the non-functional requirements for the Product Service core components, including performance, scalability, reliability, maintainability, and monitoring.

## Performance
- API response times: < 200ms for reads, < 500ms for writes (P95)
- Support for high throughput (1000+ requests/sec for reads, 100+ for writes)
- Optimize database queries and use appropriate indexes (e.g., on product name, category, status)
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data and search results
- Profile and optimize memory and CPU usage
- Conduct regular load and stress testing

## Scalability
- Support horizontal scaling (stateless service design, containerization)
- Use message queues for asynchronous processing and decoupling
- Partition/shard data for large-scale operations (e.g., by tenant, region)
- Auto-scale infrastructure based on load (Kubernetes, cloud autoscaling)
- Design APIs and events for backward compatibility

## Reliability & Availability
- Ensure high availability (99.9%+ uptime, multi-AZ deployment)
- Use database replication, failover, and backup strategies
- Implement retries, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation
- Regularly backup data and test recovery procedures
- Use health checks and readiness/liveness probes
- Design for eventual consistency where appropriate

## Maintainability
- Modular, well-documented, and testable codebase
- Automated tests and CI/CD pipelines for all changes
- Consistent coding standards, code reviews, and static analysis
- Comprehensive API and system documentation (OpenAPI, ADRs)
- Use feature flags for safe deployments

## Monitoring & Observability
- Monitor key metrics (latency, error rates, throughput, resource usage, queue depth)
- Set up alerts for failures, performance degradation, and security incidents
- Use distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) and centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack)
- Regularly review dashboards and incident postmortems

## Best Practices
- Design for failure and recovery
- Automate everything (testing, deployment, monitoring)
- Document all operational procedures
- Continuously review and improve non-functional aspects

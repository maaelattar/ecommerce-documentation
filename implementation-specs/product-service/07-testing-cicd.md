# Phase 7: Testing and CI/CD Setup

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy and CI/CD pipeline setup for the Product Service. Comprehensive testing and automated deployment processes are essential to ensure the reliability, stability, and quality of the service. This phase builds upon the work completed in previous phases, particularly leveraging the architecture and integration patterns established in Phase 6.

The testing and CI/CD approach uses AWS-native services in alignment with our AWS-centric architecture decisions. The CI/CD pipeline utilizes AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CloudFormation/CDK for infrastructure as code, while our testing strategy incorporates AWS services like CloudWatch, X-Ray, and managed infrastructure for test environments.

## 2. Testing Strategy

- **Key Focus Areas**:
  - Input validation vulnerabilities
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Sensitive data exposure
  - Dependency vulnerabilities
- **Implementation Guidelines**:

  - Regular dependency scans
  - Authentication bypass attempts
  - Authorization boundary tests

### 2.2. Test Environment Strategy

#### 2.2.1. Local Development Environment

- Docker Compose setup for local testing
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Local event broker (RabbitMQ container)
- Local PostgreSQL database

#### 2.2.2. CI Test Environment

- Ephemeral environment created and destroyed for each CI run
- AWS-based infrastructure using infrastructure as code (AWS CDK)
- Test database with pre-seeded data
- Mocked AWS services where appropriate

#### 2.2.3. Pre-Production Environment

- Mirror of production environment at smaller scale
- Realistic data volumes
- Actual AWS service integrations
- Used for performance and integration testing

### 2.3. Test Data Management

- **Test Data Generation**: Scripts to generate realistic test data
- **Data Seeding**: Automated database seeding for tests
- **Cleanup**: Proper teardown after tests complete
- **Sensitive Data**: No production data in test environments; synthetic data only

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### 3.1. Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline will be implemented using AWS CodePipeline, with the following stages:

#### 3.1.1. Source Stage

- Trigger: Push to main branch or pull request
- Source: AWS CodeCommit (or GitHub with AWS CodeStar connection)
- Branch strategy:
  - Feature branches for development
  - Main branch for integration
  - Release branches for production deployments

#### 3.1.2. Build Stage

- Uses AWS CodeBuild
- Key steps:
  - Install dependencies
  - Run linters and code quality checks
  - Execute unit tests
  - Build and package application
  - Create Docker image
  - Push to ECR repository

#### 3.1.3. Test Stage

- Uses AWS CodeBuild with separate buildspec
- Key steps:
  - Deploy to test environment
  - Run integration tests
  - Run contract tests
  - Run security scans
  - Generate test reports

#### 3.1.4. Deploy to Staging Stage

- Uses AWS CloudFormation or CDK
- Key steps:
  - Deploy to staging environment
  - Run smoke tests
  - Run performance tests (scheduled)
  - Manual approval gate for production deployment

#### 3.1.5. Deploy to Production Stage

- Uses AWS CloudFormation or CDK
- Key steps:
  - Blue/Green deployment strategy
  - Health checks
  - Rollback capability

# Product Service Event Sourcing - Overview

## 1. Introduction

This phase implements event sourcing for the Product Service to align with our Event-Driven Architecture quality standards. Event sourcing is a pattern where all changes to the application state are stored as a sequence of immutable events. This approach provides numerous benefits including complete audit history, ability to determine state at any point in time, and improved decoupling of services.

## 2. Key Benefits

- **Complete Audit History**: Every state change is captured as an immutable event, providing a comprehensive audit trail
- **Temporal Queries**: Ability to determine the state of a product at any point in time
- **Event Replay**: Enable system recovery by replaying events
- **Natural integration with event-driven architecture**: Perfectly aligns with our existing event publishing strategy
- **Improved decoupling**: Minimizes synchronous dependencies between services
- **Enhanced resilience**: Services can operate independently and recover from failures

## 3. Core Components

The event sourcing implementation for the Product Service consists of the following components:

1. **Event Store**: A specialized database to store product events
2. **Domain Events**: Well-defined events representing all state changes in the Product domain
3. **Command Handlers**: Process commands and emit events
4. **Event Handlers**: Process events and update read models
5. **Projections**: Build read models from the event stream for efficient querying
6. **Snapshots**: Periodic captures of aggregate state for performance optimization

## 4. Implementation Approach

### 4.1. Event Store Selection

We will implement the event store using Amazon DynamoDB with the following schema:
- Partition Key: `entityId` (productId, categoryId, etc.)
- Sort Key: `sequenceNumber` (auto-incrementing)
- Additional attributes: eventType, eventData, timestamp, userId, etc.

### 4.2. Command and Event Flow

1. **Commands** are validated against business rules
2. Valid commands generate **Events**
3. Events are stored in the **Event Store**
4. Events are published to the **Message Broker**
5. **Projections** subscribe to events and update read models
6. **Query APIs** read from the optimized read models

## 5. Migration Strategy

The migration to event sourcing will follow these steps:

1. Create the event store infrastructure
2. Implement event handlers and projections
3. Create initial projections from existing product data
4. Implement command handlers that emit events
5. Transition API endpoints to use command handlers
6. Validate and test the implementation

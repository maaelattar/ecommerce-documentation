# Data Model and Database Setup Overview

## Phase Objectives

This phase focuses on implementing the data model and database setup for the Product Service. The key objectives are:

1. Design and implement a flexible data model for products, categories, and related entities
2. Configure PostgreSQL database connections and TypeORM integration
3. Implement data validation and business rules
4. Set up database migrations and version control
5. Define testing strategy and security measures
6. Document non-functional requirements

## Implementation Components

The implementation is organized into the following components:

1. [Database Selection](01-database-selection.md)
   - Database technology selection
   - Amazon RDS configuration
   - Security considerations
   - Cost estimates

2. [Product Entity Model](02a-product-entity.md)
   - Core product attributes
   - Relationships and constraints
   - Business rules
   - Repository methods

3. [Category Entity Model](02b-category-entity.md)
   - Hierarchical structure
   - Relationships
   - Business rules
   - Repository methods

4. [Price and Discount Models](02c-price-models.md)
   - Price structure
   - Discount types
   - Business rules
   - Repository methods

5. [Inventory Entity Model](02d-inventory-entity.md)
   - Stock tracking
   - Inventory history
   - Business rules
   - Repository methods

6. [TypeORM Configuration](03-typeorm-config.md)
   - Database connection setup
   - Entity configuration
   - Query optimization
   - Error handling

7. [Migration Strategy](04-migration-strategy.md)
   - Version control
   - Deployment procedures
   - Rollback plans
   - Testing strategy

8. [Testing Strategy](05-testing-strategy.md)
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance testing

9. [Security Considerations](06-security-considerations.md)
   - Data protection
   - Access control
   - Audit logging
   - Input validation

10. [Non-Functional Requirements](07-non-functional-requirements.md)
    - Performance requirements
    - Scalability requirements
    - Reliability requirements
    - Maintainability requirements

## Dependencies

- Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL database instance
- TypeORM and related dependencies
- Testing frameworks and tools

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL selected for its robust features, JSON support, and scalability
2. **Flexible Attributes**: Using JSONB for product attributes to support dynamic fields
3. **Entity Relationships**: Implementing proper foreign key constraints and cascading rules
4. **Migration Strategy**: Using TypeORM migrations with version control

## Next Steps

After implementing the data model and database setup, the next phase will focus on:

1. Core service components implementation
2. API endpoints development
3. Integration with other services
4. Performance optimization

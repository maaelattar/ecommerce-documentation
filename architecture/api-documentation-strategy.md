# API Documentation Strategy

This document details the standards, tools, and processes for documenting APIs across the e-commerce platform, ensuring consistency, discoverability, and ease of integration for both internal and external consumers.

## 1. Standards & Guidelines

- All APIs must be described using the OpenAPI Specification (OAS, formerly Swagger).
- API contracts are versioned and maintained in source control alongside service code.
- API design guidelines (naming, versioning, error handling, pagination, etc.) are defined in [ADR-030](./adr/ADR-030-api-design-guidelines.md).
- Deprecation and backward compatibility policies are enforced as per [ADR-024](./adr/ADR-024-api-versioning-strategy.md).

## 2. Documentation Tools

- **Swagger UI** and **Redoc** are used to render and publish API documentation.
- API documentation is automatically generated and published as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Internal API portal aggregates all service APIs for easy discovery and search.

## 3. Documentation Content Requirements

- Endpoint definitions, request/response schemas, and status codes
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Example requests and responses
- Error codes and troubleshooting guidance
- Change logs and deprecation notices
- Rate limits and usage policies (if applicable)

## 4. Review & Maintenance Process

- API documentation is reviewed as part of code review and release processes.
- Breaking changes require approval from the architecture review board and advance notice to consumers.
- Documentation is updated with every API change and validated in CI.

## 5. External & Partner APIs

- Public APIs are published with additional guides, onboarding instructions, and usage examples.
- API keys, OAuth flows, and security best practices are documented for external consumers.

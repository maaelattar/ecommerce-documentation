# Data Flow and Data Model Integration

## Overview

This document explains how the data flow diagrams complement the data model diagrams, providing a comprehensive view of both the static data structure and the dynamic flow of information through the e-commerce platform.

## Integration Points

The data flow diagrams (from `data-flow-v0`) and data model diagrams work together to provide different perspectives of the same system:

- **Data Models (ERDs)** show the structure and relationships of data at rest
- **Data Flow Diagrams** show how data moves between components and is transformed

### Mapping Between Diagrams

| Data Flow Component | Related Data Model Diagram |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| User DB | `user-domain.puml` |
| Product DB | `product-domain.puml` |
| Order DB | `order-domain.puml` |
| Payment DB | Part of `order-domain.puml` |
| Inventory | `inventory-promotion-domain.puml` |
| Notification Process | `notification-domain.puml` |

## Key Insights from Data Flow Analysis

### User Domain

The data flow diagram reveals that user data is accessed by both the Authentication Process and User Management Process, which aligns with the entities in `user-domain.puml`. The flow shows how external Identity Providers interact with our user data.

### Product Domain

The Catalog Management Process in the data flow diagram shows how product data is queried and updated, corresponding to the entities in `product-domain.puml`. The flow highlights the importance of inventory checks during cart operations.

### Order Domain

The data flow diagram illustrates the complex journey from cart to order to fulfillment, involving multiple processes that operate on the entities defined in `order-domain.puml`. The flow shows how payment information moves between systems.

### Notification Domain

The Notification Process in the data flow diagram shows how events from various processes trigger notifications, corresponding to the event-driven model in `notification-domain.puml`.

## Consistency Checks

When updating either the data models or data flows, ensure consistency by checking:

1. All data stores in the flow diagram have corresponding entities in the data models
2. All major entities in the data models have a place in the data flow
3. Relationships between entities are respected in the data flow
4. Process boundaries align with microservice boundaries

## Visualization

To view both perspectives together:

1. Refer to the data model diagrams (`.puml` files or rendered `.png` files) for understanding data structure
2. Refer to the data flow diagram (`data_flow_diagram.jpg`) for understanding data movement
3. Use this integration document to understand how they relate

## Future Enhancements

Future work could include:

1. Adding data flow annotations to the data model diagrams
2. Creating a combined view that overlays data flow on the data model
3. Ensuring consistent naming between both diagram types
4. Adding sequence diagrams for key flows that show detailed interactions

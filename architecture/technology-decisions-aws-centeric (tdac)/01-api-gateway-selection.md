# API Gateway Selection Decision

Date: 2025-05-12  
Status: Accepted

## Context

Based on our previously accepted ADR-014 (API Gateway Strategy), we identified that a self-hosted open-source API Gateway is our preferred approach, with a preference for Kong Gateway or an Envoy-based solution. However, after further evaluation and proof-of-concept work, we have decided to use Amazon API Gateway as our API Gateway solution for the current project lifecycle.

## Decision

We have selected **Amazon API Gateway** as our API Gateway solution.

## Rationale

Amazon API Gateway is selected for the following reasons:

1. **Fully Managed Service:** AWS handles infrastructure provisioning, patching, maintenance, scaling, and high availability, significantly reducing the operational burden on the team.
2. **Deep AWS Ecosystem Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with AWS Lambda (for serverless functions), Amazon Cognito (for user authentication/authorization), IAM (for access control), AWS WAF (for web application firewall), AWS X-Ray (for distributed tracing), CloudWatch (for logging and monitoring), and other AWS services critical to our architecture.
3. **Ease of Use & Rapid Development:** Offers a user-friendly console, CLI, and IaC (CloudFormation, CDK) options for defining and deploying APIs, allowing for faster iteration cycles, especially beneficial during the current learning-focused phase of the project.
4. **Built-in Features:** Provides essential API management capabilities out-of-the-box, including:
    * Request/response transformations.
    * Multiple authorizer types (Cognito, Lambda, IAM).
    * Caching capabilities.
    * Throttling, rate limiting, and usage plans.
    * API keys for client authorization.
    * Automatic SDK generation for various languages.
5. **Scalability and Reliability:** Designed to scale automatically to handle varying loads and provides inherent high availability across AWS Availability Zones.
6. **Security:** Benefits from AWS's robust security infrastructure, DDoS protection (via AWS Shield Standard), and integration with AWS WAF for advanced security rules.
7. **Cost-Effectiveness (for current scale & managed benefits):** The pay-as-you-go model, combined with the operational costs saved by not self-managing, makes it a cost-effective solution for the current project needs.
8. **Support for Multiple API Types:** Supports RESTful APIs (HTTP and REST), WebSocket APIs, and private APIs accessible only from within a VPC.

## Implementation Details

### Key Amazon API Gateway Components and Configuration

1. **API Types & Endpoints:**
    * **Primary Use:** HTTP APIs or REST APIs will be used for synchronous request/response interactions.
    * **Endpoint Types:** Regional endpoints are typically sufficient. Edge-optimized endpoints can be considered if global low-latency access is a primary driver.
    * **Private Integrations:** For APIs that should only be accessible from within the VPC, VPC Link integrations will be used.
2. **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Primary Method:** Amazon Cognito User Pools will be used as the primary authorizer for customer-facing APIs.
    * **Service-to-Service:** IAM authorizers or Lambda authorizers (with custom token validation) can be used for protecting APIs accessed by other internal services.
    * **API Keys:** Utilize API keys and usage plans for third-party developers or B2B integrations if applicable.
3. **Request/Response Handling:**
    * **Transformations:** Use mapping templates (VTL for REST APIs, or simpler configurations for HTTP APIs) for request and response transformations where necessary.
    * **Validation:** Leverage request validation features for REST APIs to ensure incoming requests meet defined schemas.
4. **Traffic Management:**
    * **Throttling & Quotas:** Implement throttling rules (steady-state and burst) and quotas via usage plans to protect backend services and ensure fair usage.
    * **Caching:** Utilize API Gateway caching for frequently accessed, non-personalized data.
5. **Security:**
    * **AWS WAF Integration:** Integrate with AWS WAF for protection against common web exploits and to implement custom security rules.
    * **TLS:** All API Gateway endpoints are HTTPS by default, enforcing TLS.
    * **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) appropriately for frontend applications.
6. **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * **CloudWatch Logs:** Enable access logging and execution logging to CloudWatch Logs for debugging and auditing.
    * **CloudWatch Metrics:** Monitor key API Gateway metrics (e.g., `Count`, `Latency`, `4XXError`, `5XXError`) in CloudWatch.
    * **AWS X-Ray Integration:** Enable X-Ray tracing for end-to-end request tracing through API Gateway and backend services.
    * Integrate with the central monitoring solution (Amazon Managed Grafana) for dashboards and alerting.
7. **Deployment:**
    * Define API Gateway resources using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) or AWS CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
    * Manage deployments through stages (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

## Alternative Considered

**Kong Gateway (Self-Managed on EKS):** Offers high flexibility, extensive plugin ecosystem, and cloud-agnostic deployment. However, it incurs significant operational overhead for management, scaling, and security, which is counter to the current project goal of simplifying the learning curve with AWS managed services.

## Dependencies

- **Security Team:** Will need to review the API Gateway configuration and security settings (IAM roles, WAF rules, authorizers).
- **Development Teams:** Will need to adapt to the API Gateway patterns for their services (integration, authentication, logging).
- **Networking Team (if applicable):** May need to be consulted for VPC Link configurations or private endpoint setups.

## Action Items

1. Create a detailed API Gateway deployment configuration for the development environment
2. Develop CI/CD pipelines for API Gateway configuration updates
3. Document API registration and management procedures for service development teams
4. Establish monitoring dashboards for API Gateway performance and health metrics
5. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with development teams

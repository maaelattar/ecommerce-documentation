*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Date:** 2025-05-12
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** Lead Developers, Architects
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## 1. Context & Scope

This document outlines the selection of NoSQL database technologies for the e-commerce platform. It builds upon the principles outlined in [ADR-020: Data Management and Database per Service Strategy](./../adr/ADR-020-data-management-database-per-service.md), which advocates for polyglot persistence, allowing services to choose the most appropriate data store for their specific needs.

The goal is to identify suitable NoSQL databases for use cases where traditional relational databases (as per [ADR-004: PostgreSQL for Relational Data](./../adr/ADR-004-postgresql-for-relational-data.md)) may not be the optimal fit due to requirements for schema flexibility, horizontal scalability, specific data models (e.g., document, key-value, wide-column), or performance characteristics for particular access patterns.

Potential use cases for NoSQL databases within this platform include (but are not limited to):

*   Product Catalog (highly flexible product attributes, variants, rich media)
*   User Profiles, Preferences, and Personalization Data
*   Shopping Cart and Session Management
*   Real-time Inventory Management
*   Recommendations Engine data
*   High-volume application logs or analytics data
*   Content Management Systems (CMS) for marketing or informational content

## 2. Decision Drivers for NoSQL Selection (General)

The primary drivers for considering NoSQL databases include:

*   **Schema Flexibility:** Ability to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly evolving data models without requiring predefined schemas or costly schema migrations.
*   **Horizontal Scalability:** Capability to scale out by distributing data and load across multiple servers, often providing higher throughput for reads and writes than traditional RDBMS for certain workloads.
*   **Performance for Specific Access Patterns:** Optimized for high-speed reads/writes for specific query types (e.g., key-based lookups, document retrievals).
*   **Specialized Data Models:** Native support for data structures like documents (JSON/BSON), key-value pairs, wide-column families, or graphs, which can simplify development for certain use cases.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Potentially faster development cycles for applications dealing with data types that map naturally to NoSQL models.
*   **High Availability & Fault Tolerance:** Many NoSQL databases are designed with built-in replication and fault tolerance features.

## 3. Considered NoSQL Database Categories & Technologies

This section will evaluate specific NoSQL databases based on their category, strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for potential e-commerce use cases.

### 3.1. Document Databases

Store data in document format, typically JSON or BSON. Good for flexible schemas and complex data structures.

*   **Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility):**
    *   *Pros:* Managed service (less operational overhead), compatible with MongoDB drivers and tools, integrates with AWS ecosystem.
    *   *Cons:* Not fully compatible with *all* MongoDB features/APIs, potentially higher cost than self-managed MongoDB or DynamoDB for some workloads.
    *   *Potential Use Cases:* Product Catalog, User Profiles, Content Management (where MongoDB compatibility is desired in a managed service).

### 3.2. Key-Value Stores

Store data as a collection of key-value pairs. Highly performant for simple lookups.

*   **Amazon ElastiCache for Redis:**
    *   *Pros:* Managed Redis service (handles patching, scaling, monitoring, backups), offers HA features (Multi-AZ), integration with other AWS services.
    *   *Cons:* Managed service cost, potential limits on certain advanced Redis configurations compared to self-managed.
    *   *Potential Use Cases:* Caching, Session Management, Shopping Carts, Real-time counters, Leaderboards.

### 3.3. Wide-Column Stores

Store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns. Optimized for queries over large datasets, often with high write throughput.

*   **(Placeholder for AWS Keyspaces - Managed Cassandra)**

### 3.4. Search Engines (Often considered NoSQL due to document orientation)

Optimized for full-text search, aggregation, and analysis of semi-structured data.

*   **Amazon OpenSearch Service (Successor to Amazon Elasticsearch Service):**
    *   *Pros:* Managed Elasticsearch/OpenSearch service (handles deployment, scaling, patching, monitoring), integrates with AWS services (Kinesis, CloudWatch, S3), offers security features.
    *   *Cons:* Managed service cost, potential lag behind latest open-source releases, configuration limits compared to self-managed.
    *   *Potential Use Cases:* Product Search, Site Search, Log Management & Analytics, Real-time Monitoring Dashboards.

### 3.5. Graph Databases (Future Consideration)

Optimized for storing and querying highly interconnected data.

*   **Neo4j (Example):**
    *   *Pros:* Efficient for relationship-heavy queries, intuitive data model for connected data.
    *   *Cons:* Niche use cases, can be less performant for other query types.
    *   *Potential Use Cases (Future):* Recommendation Engines, Fraud Detection, Social Networks.

## 4. Selected NoSQL Technologies & Deployment (AWS Managed Services)

Based on the analysis and alignment with our AWS-centric strategy ([ADR-006](./../adr/ADR-006-cloud-native-deployment-strategy.md)), the following AWS managed NoSQL services are selected for specific use cases:

*   **Product Service (Primary Data Store: `Product DB` - PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Complementary NoSQL for Product Search:**
        *   **Choice:** Amazon OpenSearch Service
        *   *Rationale:* Provides powerful full-text search and aggregation capabilities needed for a rich product discovery experience. Managed service reduces operational overhead.
*   **Order Service (Primary Data Store: `Order DB` - PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Complementary NoSQL for Shopping Cart / Session Management:**
        *   **Choice:** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis
        *   *Rationale:* Offers extremely low-latency reads/writes required for responsive cart operations and session state. Managed service aligns with caching strategy ([ADR-009](./../adr/ADR-009-caching-strategy.md)).
*   **User Service (Primary Data Store: `User DB` - PostgreSQL - for core user info):**
    *   **Complementary NoSQL for User Profiles / Preferences / Personalization:**
        *   **Choice:** Amazon DynamoDB
        *   *Rationale:* Provides high scalability and flexibility for storing potentially diverse and evolving user profile attributes and preferences. Fits well with key-based lookups. (Note: If complex, ad-hoc querying of profile data becomes a primary driver, Amazon DocumentDB could be reconsidered.)
*   **Logging & Monitoring Services:**
    *   **Choice for Log Aggregation & Analysis:** Amazon OpenSearch Service
    *   *Rationale:* Standard choice for log analysis, integrates with AWS logging sources (e.g., CloudWatch Logs, Kinesis Data Firehose). Aligns with observability stack ([ADR-010](./../adr/ADR-010-logging-strategy.md), [ADR-011](./../adr/ADR-011-monitoring-alerting-strategy.md)).

## 5. Implementation & Operational Considerations

*   **Deployment:** Provision and manage the selected AWS managed services (**Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis, Amazon DynamoDB**) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) or CloudFormation. Self-managing these technologies on EKS is explicitly avoided to reduce operational overhead.
*   **Data Modeling:** Follow best practices specific to each chosen AWS service (e.g., OpenSearch index design, ElastiCache data structures, DynamoDB key design and access patterns).
*   **Consistency:** Understand and configure the consistency models offered by each service appropriate for the use case (e.g., eventual consistency for search indexes, strong consistency options in DynamoDB if needed, Redis persistence settings).
*   **Backup & Recovery:** Implement robust backup and restore procedures for each AWS managed service instance. Define RPO/RTO for each service.
*   **Monitoring:** Integrate with the central monitoring stack (ADR-011) to track performance metrics, errors, and resource utilization for each database.
*   **Security:** Secure access using authentication, authorization, network policies, and encryption at rest/in transit where appropriate.
*   **Expertise:** Ensure teams have or acquire the necessary skills to develop against and operate the chosen AWS managed services.

## 6. Alternatives Considered (Briefly)

*   **Using PostgreSQL Exclusively (with JSONB):** While PostgreSQL's JSONB capabilities are powerful, relying on it for all use cases might lead to performance bottlenecks or overly complex data models for highly dynamic, large-scale, or specialized data access patterns (e.g., massive write throughput for Cassandra, ultra-low latency for Redis, advanced text search for Elasticsearch).
*   **Other NoSQL Databases:** Many other NoSQL databases exist. The selected candidates represent mature, well-supported options that cover the primary categories relevant to the e-commerce platform's needs. Specific alternatives for each category were implicitly considered during the selection of the primary candidates listed in section 3.

## 7. Consequences

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improved performance and scalability for specific services.
    *   Greater flexibility in data modeling for specific use cases.
    *   Ability to choose the best AWS managed tool for the job.
    *   Reduced operational burden compared to self-managing equivalent NoSQL databases.
*   **Drawbacks/Risks:**
    *   Potential learning curve for development teams specific to AWS services (e.g., DynamoDB data modeling).
    *   Ensuring data consistency across polyglot persistence requires careful design (e.g., sagas, event-driven architecture), although managed services simplify the infrastructure aspect.
    *   Cost of managed services needs careful monitoring and optimization (e.g., DynamoDB provisioned vs. on-demand capacity, OpenSearch/ElastiCache instance sizing).

## 8. Open Issues & Future Considerations

*   Detailed data modeling for each service choosing DynamoDB, OpenSearch, or ElastiCache.
*   Performance benchmarking for chosen AWS services under expected load.
*   Evaluation and selection of a Graph Database if a sophisticated recommendation engine or other graph-based features are prioritized.
*   Refinement of backup/recovery and DR strategies for each AWS managed service.

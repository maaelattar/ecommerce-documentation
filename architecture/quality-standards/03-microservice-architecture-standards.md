# Microservice Architecture Standards

## 1. Overview

This document defines the standards and best practices for designing, implementing, and operating microservices within our e-commerce platform. These standards ensure consistent, scalable, and maintainable microservices that work together effectively to deliver business value.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1. Service Autonomy

- Services should be independently deployable with minimal dependencies
- Each service should have its own datastore and not directly access another service's data
- Each service should have clear ownership by a specific team
- Services should be resilient to failures of other services

### 2.2. Domain-Driven Design

- Services should be designed around business domains, not technical capabilities
- Boundaries between services should align with bounded contexts
- Ubiquitous language should be consistent within a service
- Domain models should be encapsulated within service boundaries

### 2.3. Single Responsibility

- Each service should have a clear, focused purpose
- Services should be sized appropriately to fulfill their responsibility
- Beware of too-small services (nanoservices) and too-large services (monoliths)
- Functionality should be cohesive within a service

### 2.4. Service Contracts

- Services should define clear, stable contracts
- Contracts should be explicitly versioned
- Breaking changes to contracts should be rare and well-managed
- Contracts should be documented and tested

## 3. Service Design

### 3.1. Service Size Guidelines

- Services should generally contain 3-10 core domain entities
- Team size: 2-5 engineers should be able to maintain a service
- Codebase size: 10,000-50,000 lines of code is typical
- Services that grow beyond these guidelines should be considered for splitting

### 3.2. Service Types

| Type        | Purpose                                          | Example                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Core Domain | Implements key business capabilities             | Order Service, Product Service          |
| Supporting  | Provides internal capabilities to other services | Payment Service, Notification Service   |
| Generic     | Provides technical capabilities                  | Authentication Service, Logging Service |
| Aggregator  | Combines data from multiple services             | Dashboard Service, Reporting Service    |
| Edge        | Interfaces with external systems                 | API Gateway, Mobile Gateway             |

### 3.3. Service Template

All services should follow a consistent template structure:

```
service-name/
├── README.md                 # Service documentation
├── Dockerfile                # Container definition

```

## 4. Inter-Service Communication

### 4.1. Communication Patterns

| Pattern                        | Use Case                                               | Implementation                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Synchronous Request-Response   | Real-time data needs, simple workflows                 | REST, gRPC                             |
| Asynchronous Events            | Notifications, eventual consistency, complex workflows | Message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) |
| Dual-Write                     | Critical data updates requiring consistency            | Transaction outbox pattern             |
| Shared Database (Anti-pattern) | Avoid except in rare, well-justified cases             | -                                      |

### 4.2. API Gateway

- Implement API Gateway for external clients
- Gateway responsibilities:
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - Request routing
  - Response transformation
  - Monitoring and logging
  - API versioning

### 4.3. Service Discovery

- Use a service registry for dynamic service discovery
- All services must register themselves
- Health check integration for service registry
- Support for multiple environments

## 5. Data Management

### 5.1. Data Ownership

- Each microservice owns its data exclusively
- No direct access to another service's database
- Data should be shared via APIs or events
- Schema changes should be managed by the owning service

### 5.2. Database Per Service

- Each service should have its own dedicated datastore
- Choose the appropriate database technology for each service's needs
- Polyglot persistence is encouraged where appropriate
- Document database technology choices and rationale

### 5.3. Data Consistency Patterns

| Pattern              | Use Case                                          | Implementation                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Transactional        | Within a single service boundary                  | Native database transactions           |
| Saga                 | Multi-service operations requiring coordination   | Choreography or orchestration patterns |
| Eventual Consistency | Non-critical data sharing across services         | Event-based updates                    |
| Outbox Pattern       | Reliable event publishing with local transactions | Database outbox table + scheduler      |

### 5.4. Data Duplication

- Duplicate data across services when necessary for:
  - Performance optimization
  - Reducing coupling
  - Ensuring availability
- Document duplicated data and update strategies
- Implement reconciliation processes for detecting inconsistencies

## 6. Resilience Patterns

### 6.1. Circuit Breakers

- Implement circuit breakers for all service-to-service communication
- Configure appropriate thresholds for tripping circuits
- Implement fallback mechanisms for degraded operation
- Monitor circuit breaker status

```typescript
// Example circuit breaker implementation
const circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker({
  service: "product-service",
  failureThreshold: 3, // Number of failures before opening
  resetTimeout: 30000, // Time before attempting to close (30s)
  fallback: (productId) => {
    // Fallback function
    return cachedProductService.getProduct(productId);
  },
});

async function getProduct(productId) {
  return circuitBreaker.execute(() => {
    return productService.getProduct(productId);
  });
}
```

### 6.2. Bulkhead Pattern

- Isolate resources for different consumers
- Prevent cascading failures through resource exhaustion
- Implement via separate connection pools, thread pools, or containers
- Configure appropriate queue sizes and timeouts

### 6.3. Retry Policies

- Implement retries with exponential backoff
- Add jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Set appropriate retry limits
- Distinguish between retriable and non-retriable errors

```typescript
// Example retry implementation
async function retriableOperation(params) {
  const options = {
    maxRetries: 3,
    initialDelayMs: 100,
    maxDelayMs: 2000,
    backoffFactor: 2,
    retryableErrors: [503, 504, 429],
  };

  return retry(async () => {
    try {
      return await externalService.operation(params);
    } catch (error) {
      if (options.retryableErrors.includes(error.status)) {
        throw error; // Will be retried
      }
      // Non-retriable error
      throw new NonRetriableError(error.message);
    }
  }, options);
}
```

### 6.4. Rate Limiting

- Implement rate limiting for all inbound requests
- Protect services from excessive load
- Configure different limits for different client types
- Return appropriate status codes with retry information

### 6.5. Timeouts

- Configure timeouts for all synchronous calls
- Default timeout should be 1-5 seconds depending on the service
- Document timeout configuration for each service
- Handle timeout exceptions gracefully

## 7. Deployment and Operations

### 7.1. Containerization

- All services must be containerized using Docker
- Containers should be immutable and built once for all environments
- Follow container best practices:
  - Use minimal base images
  - Run as non-root user
  - Include health checks
  - Optimize layers for caching

### 7.2. CI/CD Pipeline

- Each service should have its own CI/CD pipeline
- Standard pipeline stages:
  - Build and test
  - Static code analysis
  - Security scanning
  - Container image building
  - Infrastructure provisioning
  - Deployment
  - Post-deployment testing

### 7.3. Blue/Green Deployment

- Use blue/green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- Test new version in isolation before switching traffic
- Maintain ability to quickly rollback to previous version
- Monitor deployment for issues before completing

### 7.4. Configuration Management

- Externalize all configuration from the codebase
- Use environment variables for basic configuration
- Use centralized configuration service for complex configuration
- Keep secrets in a dedicated secrets management system
- Validate configuration at startup

## 8. Observability

### 8.1. Logging

- Follow structured logging practices
- Include correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log at appropriate levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- Include relevant context without sensitive information
- Ship logs to centralized logging platform

Example structured log:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-07-22T10:15:30.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "order-service",
  "correlationId": "c123456",
  "userId": "u789012",
  "message": "Order created successfully",
  "orderId": "ord456",
  "orderTotal": 123.45
}
```

### 8.2. Metrics

Required service metrics:

- Request count and rate
- Error count and rate
- Request duration (p50, p95, p99)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, connections)
- Business metrics specific to service domain
- Dependency health

### 8.3. Distributed Tracing

- Implement distributed tracing across all services
- Propagate trace context between services
- Sample traces appropriately for performance
- Capture service dependencies and latencies
- Visualize complete request flow across services

### 8.4. Health Checks

- Implement standardized health check endpoints:
  - `/health/liveness`: Service is running
  - `/health/readiness`: Service is ready to accept traffic
  - `/health/dependencies`: Status of service dependencies

Health check response format:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "timestamp": "2023-07-22T10:15:30.123Z",
  "details": {
    "database": {
      "status": "UP",
      "responseTime": 15
    },
    "cache": {
      "status": "UP",
      "responseTime": 5
    },
    "payment-service": {
      "status": "DOWN",
      "details": "Connection timeout"
    }
  }
}
```

## 9. Testing Strategy

### 9.1. Testing Pyramid

- Unit tests: 70-80% of all tests
- Integration tests: 15-20% of all tests
- End-to-end tests: 5-10% of all tests

### 9.2. Testing Types

| Test Type   | Scope                                | Responsibility   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Unit        | Individual components                | Development team |
| Integration | Service with its direct dependencies | Development team |
| Contract    | API conformance                      | Development team |
| Component   | Complete service in isolation        | Development team |
| End-to-end  | Multiple services                    | QA team          |
| Performance | Load and stress testing              | Performance team |
| Chaos       | Resilience testing                   | Platform team    |

### 9.3. Contract Testing

- Implement consumer-driven contract testing
- Test both service providers and consumers
- Automate contract testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Break the build on contract violations

Example using Pact:

```typescript
// Consumer side
const pact = new Pact({
  consumer: "order-service",
  provider: "product-service",
  log: path.resolve(process.cwd(), "logs", "pact.log"),
});

describe("Product API contract", () => {
  beforeAll(() => pact.setup());
  afterAll(() => pact.finalize());

  it("gets product details", async () => {
    await pact.addInteraction({
      state: "a product with ID 123 exists",
      uponReceiving: "a request for product 123",
      withRequest: {
        method: "GET",
        path: "/api/v1/products/123",
      },
      willRespondWith: {
        status: 200,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: {
          id: "123",
          name: like("Product Name"),
          price: like(19.99),
        },
      },
    });

    const result = await productClient.getProduct("123");
    expect(result).toHaveProperty("id", "123");
  });
});
```

## 10. Security

### 10.1. Authentication and Authorization

- Implement service-to-service authentication
- Use mutual TLS or JWT tokens for service authentication
- Define clear authorization roles and permissions
- Validate all authorization claims on the server side

### 10.2. Secret Management

- Store secrets in a dedicated secrets management system
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Never commit secrets to source control
- Inject secrets at runtime, not build time

### 10.3. Network Security

- Implement network segmentation
- Use service mesh for secure communication
- Encrypt all traffic with TLS
- Implement proper network policies

### 10.4. Security Testing

- Regular security scans of container images

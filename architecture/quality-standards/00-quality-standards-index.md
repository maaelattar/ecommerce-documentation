# Quality Standards Index

## Overview

This index provides a guide to the quality standards documentation for our e-commerce platform. These standards define the architectural principles, patterns, and best practices that all services and components must adhere to, ensuring a consistent, maintainable, and high-quality platform.

## Core Standards

| Standard                                                                                     | Description                                                             | Key Topics                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Event-Driven Architecture Standards](./01-event-driven-architecture-standards.md)           | Guidelines for implementing event-driven communication between services | Event design, messaging patterns, resilience, observability   |
| [API Design Standards](./02-api-design-standards.md)                                         | Standards for designing, implementing, and maintaining service APIs     | RESTful design, versioning, documentation, security           |
| [Microservice Architecture Standards](./03-microservice-architecture-standards.md)           | Principles and patterns for microservice design and implementation      | Service autonomy, communication, deployment, testing          |
| [Data Integrity and Consistency Standards](./04-data-integrity-and-consistency-standards.md) | Guidelines for ensuring data reliability across distributed services    | Consistency models, transactions, validation, synchronization |
| [Security Standards](./05-security-standards.md)                                             | Comprehensive security requirements and best practices                  | Authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance    |

## Upcoming Standards

The following standards are planned for future development:

1. **Infrastructure as Code Standards** - Guidelines for defining infrastructure using code
2. **DevOps Standards** - Standards for CI/CD, deployment, and operational practices
3. **Performance and Scalability Standards** - Requirements for service performance and scale
4. **Mobile API Standards** - Specific guidelines for mobile-facing APIs
5. **Frontend Architecture Standards** - Standards for web and mobile clients

## How to Use These Standards

### For New Services

When designing and implementing a new service:

1. Review all applicable standards before beginning design
2. Incorporate these standards into architectural decision records
3. Use standards as acceptance criteria for code reviews
4. Conduct a standards compliance review before production deployment

### For Existing Services

For existing services:

1. Perform a gap analysis against these standards
2. Prioritize remediation of critical gaps
3. Create a plan to address remaining gaps during regular maintenance
4. Include standards compliance in future enhancements

## Contribution and Governance

These standards are maintained by the Architecture Team with input from all development teams. To suggest changes:

1. Create a pull request with proposed changes
2. Include rationale and impact analysis
3. Standards changes require review and approval from the Architecture Review Board

## Review Cycle

All standards are reviewed and updated quarterly to ensure they remain current with technology trends and organizational needs.

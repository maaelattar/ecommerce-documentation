# Cost Management & FinOps

This document describes the strategies, tools, and processes for managing cloud costs and implementing FinOps practices across the e-commerce platform.

## 1. Cost Monitoring & Reporting

- Use cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing, Azure Cost Management) for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.
- Integrate third-party FinOps platforms (e.g., CloudHealth, Cloudability) for advanced reporting, forecasting, and anomaly detection.
- Dashboards and reports are shared with engineering, finance, and leadership on a regular cadence.

## 2. Budgeting & Alerts

- Set budgets for each environment (dev, staging, production) and major service or team.
- Configure automated alerts for budget thresholds, unexpected spikes, or anomalies.
- Review and adjust budgets quarterly or as business needs change.

## 3. Cost Allocation & Tagging

- Enforce tagging standards for all cloud resources (e.g., team, service, environment, project).
- Use tags to allocate costs by team, product, or business unit for chargeback/showback.
- Regularly audit tags for completeness and accuracy.

## 4. Optimization Practices

- Rightsize compute, storage, and database resources based on usage patterns.
- Use reserved instances, savings plans, or committed use discounts where appropriate.
- Enable autoscaling and serverless where possible to match demand and reduce waste.
- Decommission unused or underutilized resources promptly.

## 5. FinOps Culture & Governance

- Empower engineers to monitor and optimize their own cloud usage with self-service dashboards.
- Hold regular FinOps reviews to identify savings opportunities and share best practices.
- Include cost efficiency as a non-functional requirement in architectural decisions and ADRs.
- Collaborate with finance to align cloud spend with business goals and forecasts.

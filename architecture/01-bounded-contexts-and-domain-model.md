# Bounded Contexts and Core Domain Model

Date: {{TIMESTAMP}}
Status: Draft

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the identified Bounded Contexts for the E-commerce Platform. Each context represents a specific area of business concern with its own dedicated domain model and ubiquitous language. Defining these contexts helps in designing cohesive, loosely coupled microservices.

Refer to `ADR-001-adoption-of-microservices-architecture.md` and the `00-system-architecture-overview.md` for the overarching architectural principles like Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

## 2. Identified Bounded Contexts & Core Entities

Here's a preliminary list of Bounded Contexts. Each context will likely map to one or more microservices.

*   **Core Entities:** `SellerProfile`, `SellerProductListing`, `SellerPayout`.
*   **Potential Services:** Seller Service.

## 3. Context Map (High-Level)

A detailed visual Context Map can be developed, but at a high level, these contexts interact in various ways:

*   **Upstream/Downstream:** e.g., Product Catalog is upstream to Shopping Cart.
*   **Customer/Supplier:** e.g., Payment Service is a supplier to Checkout.
*   **Shared Kernel:** (To be minimized) e.g., common User ID format.
*   **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL):** Used when integrating contexts with different models.
*   **Open Host Service (OHS) / Published Language (PL):** Defines how contexts expose their capabilities.

Key interactions will be further detailed via Sequence Diagrams for critical user journeys.

## 4. Next Steps

*   Refine entity attributes and relationships within each context.
*   Develop a visual Context Map.
*   Align specific microservices to these bounded contexts.
*   Ensure Ubiquitous Language is defined and used consistently within each context's team.

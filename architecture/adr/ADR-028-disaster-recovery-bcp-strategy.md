# ADR-028: Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Plan (BCP) Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11
*   **Deciders:** Project Team, Business Stakeholders, Management
*   **Consulted:** DevOps/SRE Team, Lead Developers, Security Team
*   **Informed:** All technical and business stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

While ADR-025 covers Data Backup and Recovery, Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning (BCP) address broader strategies to ensure the entire e-commerce platform can recover from major disasters (e.g., regional outages, data center failures, catastrophic cyber-attacks) and critical business operations can continue with minimal disruption. This ADR outlines the framework for our DR and BCP strategy.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Business Resilience:** Ensure the business can survive and recover from significant disruptive events.
*   **Service Availability:** Minimize downtime for critical services during and after a disaster.
*   **Data Integrity:** Protect critical data from loss during a disaster.
*   **Reputation and Trust:** Maintain customer trust by demonstrating preparedness and resilience.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Meet any applicable legal or regulatory requirements for DR/BCP.
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for the System:** Define the target time to restore essential services after a disaster.
*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for the System:** Define the maximum acceptable data loss across the system in a DR scenario (often linked to backup frequency - ADR-025).

## Considered DR Strategies

Based on RTO/RPO requirements and cost, common DR strategies include:

1.  **Backup and Restore:** Rely on data backups (ADR-025) to restore systems to a new location. Longest RTO.
2.  **Pilot Light:** Maintain a minimal version of the environment in a DR region. Core infrastructure is running, but application services are idle until needed.
3.  **Warm Standby (Active/Passive):** Maintain a scaled-down but fully functional version of the production environment in a DR region. Data is regularly replicated. Faster RTO than Pilot Light.
4.  **Hot Standby (Active/Active or Multi-Site):** Run the application in multiple active regions simultaneously. Traffic can be dynamically routed away from an affected region. Shortest RTO, but most complex and costly.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Approach:** A phased approach, starting with a **Warm Standby (Active/Passive)** strategy for critical services, with the goal of evolving towards Hot Standby for key components as maturity and budget allow. This will leverage our Kubernetes (ADR-006) infrastructure and cloud provider capabilities.

*   **Scope of DR Plan:** The DR plan will initially focus on critical services essential for core e-commerce operations (e.g., product catalog, user accounts, cart, checkout, order processing, payments).
*   **DR Region:** Designate a secondary cloud region as the DR site. This region should be geographically distant from the primary region to protect against regional disasters.
*   **Data Replication:**
    *   Critical service data (ADR-020) MUST be asynchronously replicated from the primary region to the DR region. The frequency of replication will be determined by the service's RPO (ADR-025).
    *   Leverage database-native replication features or cloud provider replication services.
*   **Infrastructure in DR Region (Warm Standby):**
    *   Maintain a scaled-down but functional Kubernetes cluster and essential supporting infrastructure (networking, load balancers, API Gateway - ADR-014 stubs) in the DR region.
    *   Container images for critical services will be available in the DR region's container registry.
    *   Configuration (ADR-016) for services in the DR region will be maintained and synchronized.
*   **Failover Process:**
    *   Define a clear, documented manual (initially) or semi-automated (eventually automated) failover process to switch traffic and operations to the DR region.
    *   This process will involve:
        1.  Declaring a disaster.
        2.  Ensuring data in DR is consistent up to the RPO.
        3.  Scaling up application services in the DR Kubernetes cluster.
        4.  Updating DNS records or global load balancer configurations to redirect traffic to the DR region.
        5.  Validating system functionality in the DR region.
*   **Failback Process:**
    *   Define a process for restoring operations back to the primary region once it is recovered and stable. This includes data synchronization back to the primary.
*   **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):**
    *   The BCP will outline procedures for maintaining essential business operations (e.g., customer support, order fulfillment communication) during a major system outage, even if IT systems are partially or fully unavailable.
    *   Identify critical business processes, dependencies, and manual workarounds.
*   **DR Testing:**
    *   Regularly test the DR failover process (e.g., annually or bi-annually). This could involve tabletop exercises initially, followed by partial and eventually full failover tests to the DR environment.
    *   Validate RTO and RPO targets during tests.
*   **Documentation and Training:**
    *   Maintain comprehensive DR and BCP documentation.
    *   Train relevant personnel on their roles and responsibilities during a DR event.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   Provides a structured approach to recover from major disasters.
    *   Improves overall business resilience and service availability.
    *   Warm Standby offers a balance between recovery time and cost for critical services.
    *   Reduces the potential financial and reputational impact of a disaster.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Implementing and maintaining a DR environment incurs significant costs (infrastructure, data replication, testing).
    *   DR testing can be complex and potentially disruptive if not planned carefully.
    *   Achieving low RTO/RPO requires sophisticated solutions and continuous effort.
    *   BCP requires cross-departmental coordination and planning.
*   **Risks:**
    *   DR plan may become outdated if not regularly reviewed and updated with system changes.
    *   Failover process might not work as expected if not thoroughly tested.
    *   Data divergence between primary and DR sites if replication is not robust.
    *   Underestimation of resources or time needed for recovery.

## Next Steps

*   Conduct a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to identify critical business processes and their RTO/RPO requirements.
*   Select a DR cloud region.
*   Design and provision the initial Warm Standby infrastructure in the DR region for a pilot set of critical services.
*   Implement data replication mechanisms for these pilot services.
*   Develop the initial DR failover/failback procedures and BCP documentation.
*   Plan and execute the first tabletop DR exercise.

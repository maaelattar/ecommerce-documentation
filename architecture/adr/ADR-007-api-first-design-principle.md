# ADR: API-First Design Principle

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11 (User to confirm/update actual decision date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** (N/A - Lead Developers, Architects if distinct)
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders, Product Management

## Context and Problem Statement

In a microservices architecture, services communicate with each other and with client applications (web, mobile, third-party integrations) primarily through APIs. To ensure consistency, facilitate parallel development, improve collaboration between teams (frontend, backend, different service teams), and create a better developer experience for API consumers, a clear strategy for API design and development is needed. The "API-First" approach prioritizes the design and contract of an API before its implementation.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Clear Contracts:** Well-defined API contracts act as a source of truth for interactions.
*   **Parallel Development:** Frontend and backend teams (or different service teams) can work concurrently using API mocks generated from the contract.
*   **Improved Collaboration & Communication:** Facilitates discussions and feedback on API design early in the lifecycle.
*   **Better Developer Experience (DX):** Consistent, predictable, and well-documented APIs are easier for consumers to integrate with.
*   **Reduced Integration Issues:** Early agreement on contracts minimizes misunderstandings and integration problems later.
*   **Facilitates Automation:** API contracts can be used to generate documentation, client SDKs, server stubs, and test cases.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Thinking about the API as a product encourages better design for longevity and evolution.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: API-First Design

*   **Description:** The API contract (e.g., using OpenAPI Specification) is designed and reviewed collaboratively before any implementation code is written. This contract then drives the development, documentation, and testing.
*   **Pros:**
    *   All benefits listed in "Decision Drivers" are directly supported.
    *   Encourages treating APIs as primary products.
    *   Enables early feedback from API consumers.
    *   Strongly supports automated tooling for documentation, mocking, testing, and code generation.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Initial Upfront Effort:** Requires dedicated time for API design before implementation can begin, which might feel slower initially for very small, simple changes.
    *   **Potential for Over-Design:** Risk of designing APIs that are too complex or not perfectly aligned with implementation realities if not iterated upon.
    *   **Requires Discipline:** Team needs to adhere to the process of designing first.

### Option 2: Code-First (Implementation-First) Design

*   **Description:** APIs are defined implicitly through the implementation of service endpoints. API documentation might be generated from code annotations (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI decorators in NestJS, or annotations in Spring Boot).
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Faster Initial Development for Simple APIs:** Can be quicker to get a basic endpoint working without a separate design step.
    *   **API Always Reflects Implementation:** Documentation generated from code is less likely to be out of sync (if generation is diligent).
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Contracts Defined Late:** API consumers (frontend, other services) must wait for backend implementation to understand the API.
    *   **Difficult Parallel Development:** Hinders concurrent work by different teams.
    *   **Inconsistent APIs:** Higher risk of inconsistencies across different services or endpoints if not carefully managed.
    *   **Developer Experience as an Afterthought:** APIs might be designed based on internal implementation details rather than consumer needs.
    *   **Harder to Get Early Feedback:** Feedback comes only after implementation.
    *   **Integration Issues More Likely:** Misunderstandings about API behavior are discovered later.

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Design for Major, Code-First for Minor)

*   **Description:** Apply API-First for new services or significant changes to existing APIs. For very minor changes or internal-only, non-critical APIs, a code-first approach might be permitted.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Pragmatic Balance:** Attempts to get the benefits of API-First where it matters most, without the overhead for trivial changes.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Ambiguity:** Defining "significant" vs. "minor" can be subjective and lead to inconsistent application of the principle.
    *   **Risk of "Skipping" Design:** Teams might default to code-first more often than intended.
    *   **Still Loses Benefits for "Minor" Changes:** Even small changes can impact consumers; a contract update would still be beneficial.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** API-First Design

**Reasoning:**
Adopting an API-First design principle is crucial for the success of the e-commerce platform's microservices architecture. It ensures that APIs are treated as first-class citizens and productively serve their consumers.
The process will involve:
1.  **Collaborative Design:** API endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication mechanisms will be designed collaboratively, involving backend developers, frontend developers (if applicable), and product owners.
2.  **API Specification:** Designs will be captured using the OpenAPI Specification (OAS, formerly Swagger). This specification will be version-controlled.
3.  **Review and Feedback:** The OAS document will be reviewed by stakeholders before implementation begins.
4.  **Mocking & Parallel Work:** Mock servers generated from the OAS will enable frontend and other service teams to start development in parallel.
5.  **Implementation:** Backend services will implement the API according to the agreed-upon contract.
6.  **Automated Tooling:** Leverage the OAS for generating documentation, server stubs (e.g., in NestJS), client SDKs, and contract tests.

While this approach requires an initial investment in design, the long-term benefits in terms of collaboration, consistency, reduced integration friction, and better overall API quality significantly outweigh the perceived initial slowness. It aligns with modern best practices for developing distributed systems.

### Positive Consequences
*   Clear, consistent, and well-documented APIs across all services.
*   Improved collaboration and communication between teams.
*   Enables parallel development, accelerating overall project velocity.
*   Reduced integration errors and rework.
*   Better developer experience for API consumers (internal and potentially external).
*   APIs are designed with the consumer in mind.
*   Facilitates automated testing, documentation, and code generation.

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   **Upfront Design Time:** Requires time for design and review before implementation.
    *   **Mitigation:** Integrate API design into the sprint planning process. Use efficient tooling for OAS creation and review. This is an investment, not just overhead.
*   **Learning Curve for OAS/API Design Tools:** Teams need to be proficient with OpenAPI and related tools.
    *   **Mitigation:** Provide training and establish clear guidelines/templates for API design.
*   **Risk of Design-Implementation Mismatch:** If the implementation deviates from the contract.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement contract testing to ensure the implementation adheres to the OpenAPI specification. Regular communication during implementation.

## Future Considerations

*   Selection of specific tooling for OpenAPI design, validation, mocking, and documentation generation (e.g., Stoplight, Swagger Editor/UI, Postman).
*   Establishment of a centralized API catalog or developer portal.
*   ~~Define detailed API design guidelines (naming conventions, versioning strategy, error handling, pagination, filtering, etc.).~~ (Completed via [ADR-030](./ADR-030-api-design-guidelines.md))
*   Integrate contract testing into CI/CD pipelines.

## Rejection Criteria

*   If the process becomes overly bureaucratic and demonstrably slows down development for all types of changes without providing commensurate value, a more lightweight or hybrid approach might be reconsidered.
*   If the chosen tooling for API design and specification proves to be a significant bottleneck or hindrance.

# ADR: Observability Enhancements

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-12
*   **Deciders:** [Architecture Team]
*   **Consulted:** [DevOps, SRE]
*   **Informed:** [All Engineering Teams]

## Context and Problem Statement

Distributed microservices require comprehensive observability for proactive monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance optimization. Without a unified approach, incident response is slow and root cause analysis is difficult.

## Decision Drivers
*   Incident detection and response
*   System reliability and user trust
*   Compliance and audit requirements
*   Proactive capacity planning

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Centralized Observability Stack (Tracing, Logging, Metrics)
*   Description: Implement distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger), centralized logging (ELK/EFK), and metrics (Prometheus, Grafana) across all services.
*   Pros:
    *   Unified view of system health
    *   Faster incident response
    *   Supports SLO/SLA monitoring
*   Cons:
    *   Resource/storage overhead
    *   Requires instrumentation and maintenance

### Option 2: Ad-hoc Monitoring per Service
*   Description: Allow each team to implement their own monitoring and logging solutions.
*   Pros:
    *   Flexibility for teams
    *   Lower initial setup
*   Cons:
    *   Inconsistent data and visibility
    *   Harder to correlate incidents
    *   Increased support burden

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Centralized Observability Stack (Tracing, Logging, Metrics)

**Reasoning:**
A centralized approach enables rapid detection and resolution of incidents, supports compliance, and provides actionable insights for capacity planning. The operational overhead is justified by improved reliability and reduced downtime.

### Positive Consequences
*   Faster incident response and root cause analysis
*   Improved system reliability and user trust
*   Increased operational insight

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   Additional resource/storage requirements (Mitigation: Tune retention policies, use efficient storage)
*   Instrumentation effort (Mitigation: Provide libraries and templates)

### Neutral Consequences
*   May require migration from legacy monitoring tools

## Future Considerations (Optional)
*   Integrate with incident management tools (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
*   Automate alert tuning and runbook generation

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)
*   If observability stack becomes unmanageable or cost-prohibitive, revisit approach

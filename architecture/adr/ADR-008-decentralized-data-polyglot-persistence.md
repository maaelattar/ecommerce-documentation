# ADR: Decentralized Data Management & Polyglot Persistence

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11 (User to confirm/update actual decision date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** (N/A - Lead Developers, Data Architects if available)
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

In a microservices architecture (as per ADR-001), each service is designed to be autonomous and independently deployable. A critical aspect of this autonomy is how services manage their data. The choice of data management strategy impacts service coupling, scalability, resilience, and the ability to use the most appropriate data storage technology for each service's specific requirements. This ADR addresses the approach to data storage and management across the e-commerce platform.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Service Autonomy & Loose Coupling:** Services should own their data schemas and storage, minimizing dependencies on other services' data structures.
*   **Optimized Data Storage (Fit-for-Purpose):** Enable services to use database technologies best suited to their specific data model, access patterns, and non-functional requirements (e.g., relational, document, key-value, graph, time-series).
*   **Scalability:** Data stores should be scalable independently per service based on their individual load.
*   **Resilience:** Data store failures in one service should have minimal direct impact on the data stores or availability of other unrelated services.
*   **Performance:** Tailoring data models and storage solutions to specific service needs can improve query performance and data access efficiency.
*   **Technology Flexibility:** Allow teams to leverage new or specialized database technologies where appropriate.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Decentralized Data Management with Polyglot Persistence

*   **Description:** Each microservice is solely responsible for its own database(s). Services choose the type and instance of database technology (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch) that best fits their needs. Communication between services for data access happens exclusively through their APIs.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Strong Service Autonomy:** True ownership of data and schema by each service.
    *   **Optimal Data Store per Service:** Maximizes performance, scalability, and suitability for each service's specific domain.
    *   **Improved Fault Isolation:** A database failure in one service is less likely to directly cascade to others.
    *   **Independent Scalability of Data Stores.**
    *   **Enables Technology Evolution:** Services can adopt newer database technologies without impacting the entire system.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Cross-Service Data Consistency:** Managing transactions and consistency across multiple services (and their disparate databases) is complex (e.g., eventual consistency is often required).
    *   **Data Aggregation & Reporting:** Querying and reporting across data spread over multiple, potentially different, databases can be challenging.
    *   **Increased Operational Complexity:** Managing, monitoring, and backing up a diverse set of database technologies.
    *   **Skill Diversification:** Requires broader database expertise across teams or a strong platform team.

### Option 2: Shared, Centralized Database(s)

*   **Description:** Multiple microservices share one or a few large, centralized databases. Services might share schemas or have their own schemas within the shared database.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Simpler Data Consistency:** ACID transactions can often span data used by multiple services within the same database.
    *   **Easier Data Aggregation & Reporting:** All data is in one place (or fewer places).
    *   **Reduced Operational Diversity:** Fewer types of databases to manage.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Tight Coupling:** Services become coupled at the database level. Changes to a shared schema can impact multiple services.
    *   **Reduced Service Autonomy:** Services don't fully own their data lifecycle.
    *   **"One Size Fits All" Problem:** The chosen database may not be optimal for all services.
    *   **Scalability Bottlenecks:** The central database can become a performance and scalability bottleneck for the entire system.
    *   **Database as Monolith:** Contradicts the principles of microservice architecture.
    *   **Increased Risk of Widespread Outages:** A failure in the central database can impact many services.

### Option 3: Standardized Database Type per Service Category

*   **Description:** While data is decentralized per service, the *type* of database is standardized based on the category of service (e.g., all "transactional" services must use PostgreSQL, all "caching" services use Redis, all "search" services use Elasticsearch). Each service still gets its own instance.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Reduced Operational Complexity:** Limits the number of different database technologies to support compared to full polyglot persistence.
    *   **Focused Expertise:** Allows teams to build deeper expertise in a smaller set of database technologies.
    *   **Easier to Establish Common Tooling & Best Practices.**
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Less Optimal Fit:** May still force some services into a database type that isn't perfectly suited if their needs within a category are diverse.
    *   **Reduced Flexibility:** Slower to adopt new or niche database technologies that might offer significant advantages for specific services.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Decentralized Data Management with Polyglot Persistence

**Reasoning:**
Decentralized data management with polyglot persistence aligns best with the core principles of microservice architecture: autonomy, loose coupling, and independent scalability. It empowers each service team to select the most appropriate data storage technology for their specific needs, leading to better performance, optimized resource usage, and greater agility.

While this approach introduces challenges, particularly around cross-service data consistency and operational management, these are addressable through other architectural choices and practices:
*   **Eventual Consistency:** Leveraging Event-Driven Architecture (ADR-002) and patterns like sagas to manage transactions spanning multiple services.
*   **Managed Cloud Services:** Utilizing managed database offerings from cloud providers (as per ADR-004 for PostgreSQL, and similarly for other chosen databases) to reduce operational overhead.
*   **API-First Design (ADR-007):** Services interact via well-defined APIs, not by directly accessing each other's databases.
*   **Data Lake/Warehouse Strategy:** For complex cross-service reporting and analytics, data can be aggregated into a separate data lake or warehouse.

This decision acknowledges that the benefits of service autonomy and optimized data storage significantly outweigh the complexities, which can be managed with deliberate design and appropriate tooling.

### Positive Consequences
*   Services can use the most suitable data store for their specific requirements.
*   Improved performance and scalability for individual services.
*   Enhanced fault isolation at the data layer.
*   Increased team autonomy and ability to innovate with data technologies.
*   Clear data ownership boundaries.

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   **Cross-Service Data Consistency:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement eventual consistency using sagas, event sourcing, and other patterns. Design services to be resilient to eventual consistency. Clearly define consistency requirements for each business process.
*   **Operational Complexity of Diverse Databases:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Heavily rely on managed cloud database services. Invest in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for database provisioning. Develop platform capabilities or a "paved road" for common database types. Provide central expertise and support.
*   **Data Aggregation for Reporting/Analytics:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a data lake or data warehouse strategy. Use Change Data Capture (CDC) or event sourcing to feed data into the analytical store. Build dedicated analytical services.
*   **Requires Broader Skillset:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Encourage learning and cross-training. Provide access to training resources. Foster a community of practice around data technologies.

## Future Considerations

*   Develop clear guidelines and a decision framework for selecting appropriate database technologies for new services.
*   Establish patterns for data synchronization and replication between services if strictly needed (though direct synchronization is to be minimized).
*   Define data governance policies in a decentralized model (e.g., data quality, security, archival).
*   Plan for tooling and expertise for chosen NoSQL database types (e.g., document stores, key-value stores, message brokers with persistence like Kafka).

## Rejection Criteria

*   If the complexity of achieving required levels of data consistency across services using eventual consistency patterns proves insurmountable for critical business workflows.
*   If the operational overhead and cost of supporting a diverse set of managed database services become prohibitive for the organization's scale and capabilities.

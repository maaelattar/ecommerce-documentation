# ADR: Scalability Patterns

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-12
*   **Deciders:** [Architecture Team]
*   **Consulted:** [DevOps, SRE]
*   **Informed:** [All Engineering Teams]

## Context and Problem Statement

Ecommerce systems must handle unpredictable growth in users, data, and transactions. Without scalable patterns, the platform risks outages, degraded performance, and inability to support business growth or peak events.

## Decision Drivers
*   Performance and availability
*   Business growth and global reach
*   Predictable scaling costs
*   Resilience under load

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Adopt Proven Scalability Patterns
*   Description: Use horizontal scaling, auto-scaling, caching, CDN, database sharding, and graceful degradation. Employ asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks.
*   Pros:
    *   Consistent performance under load
    *   Supports business growth
    *   Reduces risk of outages
*   Cons:
    *   Increased deployment and monitoring complexity
    *   Requires regular testing and tuning

### Option 2: Vertical Scaling and Manual Intervention
*   Description: Scale by increasing resources on existing servers and manually responding to load spikes.
*   Pros:
    *   Simpler initial setup
    *   No need for distributed system expertise
*   Cons:
    *   Limited scalability
    *   Higher risk of outages during spikes
    *   Harder to automate and predict costs

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Adopt Proven Scalability Patterns

**Reasoning:**
Horizontal scaling, auto-scaling, and distributed patterns are industry best practices for modern ecommerce. They provide resilience, flexibility, and cost control, outweighing the added complexity.

### Positive Consequences
*   Improved system performance and availability
*   Predictable scaling costs
*   Supports global business growth

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   Additional complexity (Mitigation: Use automation, monitoring, and regular load testing)
*   Requires ongoing tuning (Mitigation: Schedule periodic reviews)

### Neutral Consequences
*   May require migration from legacy monolithic systems

## Future Considerations (Optional)
*   Explore serverless and edge computing for further scalability
*   Automate scaling policy updates based on business metrics

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)
*   If complexity or cost outweighs benefits, reconsider or simplify scaling approach

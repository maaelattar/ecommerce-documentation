# ADR-035: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}} (Please update with current date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** Lead Developers, QA Lead/Engineers, SRE/Ops Team
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

Our e-commerce platform, built on a microservices architecture ([ADR-001](./ADR-001-adoption-of-microservices-architecture.md)), involves numerous independent services that communicate via APIs ([ADR-007](./ADR-007-api-first-design-principle.md), [ADR-030](./ADR-030-api-design-guidelines.md)) and events ([ADR-002](./ADR-002-adoption-of-event-driven-architecture.md)). Ensuring the reliability, correctness, and performance of individual services and the system as a whole requires a multi-layered testing strategy. 

[ADR-031: Code Quality, Static Analysis, and Review Standards](./ADR-031-code-quality-static-analysis-review-standards.md) lays the groundwork for code-level quality. This ADR expands on that by defining the various types of automated and manual testing that will be implemented throughout the development lifecycle to prevent regressions, validate functionality, and ensure system stability.

## Decision Drivers

*   **High Quality & Reliability:** Deliver a robust and dependable platform to users.
*   **Early Bug Detection:** Identify and fix issues as early as possible in the development cycle, reducing cost and impact.
*   **Confidence in Releases:** Enable frequent and safe deployments to production.
*   **Maintainability:** Ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
*   **Scalability & Performance:** Verify that the system can handle expected loads and performs efficiently.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Provide fast feedback to developers and reduce manual testing effort.
*   **Clear Test Scope:** Define what to test at each level to avoid gaps and redundant efforts.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Minimalist Testing (Primarily Unit and Manual E2E)

*   **Description:** Focus heavily on unit tests for individual components and rely on manual end-to-end testing before releases.
*   **Pros:** Lower initial effort in test automation setup for complex scenarios.
*   **Cons:** 
    *   Brittle and slow E2E manual tests.
    *   Late discovery of integration issues.
    *   Difficult to achieve high release velocity with confidence.
    *   Doesn't effectively cover inter-service contract validation.
    *   Performance issues might go unnoticed until late stages.

### Option 2: Comprehensive, Automated, Multi-Layered Testing (Test Pyramid / Honeycomb)

*   **Description:** Implement a balanced mix of automated tests at different levels: extensive unit tests, focused integration tests, consumer-driven contract tests, and selective end-to-end tests. Performance and security testing are also integral parts.
*   **Pros:** 
    *   Faster feedback loops at lower levels (unit, integration).
    *   More reliable and faster validation of inter-service contracts.
    *   Reduced reliance on slow and flaky E2E tests for all scenarios.
    *   Higher confidence in releases and supports CI/CD practices.
    *   Addresses various aspects of quality (functional, performance, security).
*   **Cons:**
    *   Higher initial investment in setting up automation frameworks and writing tests for different layers.
    *   Requires discipline and skill from the development team to write and maintain various types of tests.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** **Comprehensive, Automated, Multi-Layered Testing**

We will adopt a comprehensive testing strategy that emphasizes automation across multiple layers of the test pyramid/honeycomb. This approach is essential for building a high-quality, resilient, and scalable microservices-based e-commerce platform.

**Reasoning:**

Given the complexity of a distributed microservices architecture, relying on primarily manual or only unit testing is insufficient. A multi-layered strategy provides the best balance of fast feedback, thoroughness, and confidence. Automated tests at various levels (unit, integration, contract, E2E) allow for rapid validation of changes and are crucial for enabling CI/CD and maintaining a high release velocity. Addressing performance and security as part of the testing strategy is also non-negotiable for an e-commerce platform.

## Key Testing Layers and Strategies

1.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   **Scope:** Test individual modules, classes, and functions in isolation. Focus on business logic within a service's components.
    *   **Tools:** Jest (as NestJS comes with built-in support), or other suitable xUnit-style frameworks per language/service if Node.js/NestJS isn't used universally.
    *   **Responsibility:** Developers.
    *   **Goal:** High code coverage (e.g., >80-90% for critical logic) to ensure component correctness.

2.  **Integration Testing (Intra-Service):**
    *   **Scope:** Test the interaction between components within a single service, including its interactions with its dedicated database, in-memory caches, or other direct dependencies that are part of the service's deployable unit.
    *   **Tools:** Jest, Supertest (for HTTP endpoints within NestJS), test containers (e.g., for PostgreSQL).
    *   **Responsibility:** Developers.
    *   **Goal:** Verify that the service's internal components work together as expected.

3.  **Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (Inter-Service):**
    *   **Scope:** Verify that a service (provider) adheres to the API contract expected by its consumers, and that consumers can correctly interact with the provider's API. This focuses on the interaction points (API requests/responses, message formats).
    *   **Tools:** Pact, Spring Cloud Contract (or similar).
    *   **Responsibility:** Collaborative effort between consumer and provider teams.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure independent deployability of services without breaking inter-service communication. Prevent integration issues early.

4.  **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   **Scope:** Test complete user flows through the system, involving multiple services. These tests should be selective and focus on critical user journeys.
    *   **Tools:** Cypress, Playwright, Selenium (for UI-driven E2E); REST Assured, Postman/Newman (for API-driven E2E).
    *   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers, with support from Developers.
    *   **Goal:** Validate that the overall system functions correctly from a user's perspective for key scenarios. Keep these tests minimal due to their cost and flakiness.

5.  **Performance Testing:**
    *   **Scope:** Includes load testing (normal and peak expected load), stress testing (beyond normal limits), soak testing (sustained load over time), and spike testing.
    *   **Tools:** k6, JMeter, Locust, Gatling.
    *   **Responsibility:** Performance Engineers/SRE, with support from Developers.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the system meets performance NFRs (latency, throughput, resource utilization) and identify bottlenecks.

6.  **Security Testing:**
    *   **Scope:** Includes SAST (Static Application Security Testing), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), dependency vulnerability scanning, and periodic penetration testing.
    *   **Tools:** Linters/scanners integrated into CI (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot, SonarQube for SAST), OWASP ZAP (for DAST).
    *   **Responsibility:** Security Team, Developers (for SAST/dependency scans), external vendors (for penetration testing).
    *   **Goal:** Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities proactively.

7.  **Acceptance Testing (UAT - User Acceptance Testing):**
    *   **Scope:** Business stakeholders and product owners validate that the system meets business requirements and user expectations.
    *   **Process:** Typically manual, based on defined user stories and acceptance criteria, performed in a staging-like environment.
    *   **Responsibility:** Product Owners, Business Analysts, select end-users.
    *   **Goal:** Confirm fitness for purpose from a business perspective before release.

## CI/CD Integration

*   Unit, integration, and contract tests will be run automatically on every commit/pull request.
*   E2E tests (a subset) may run on PRs to key branches or nightly against a staging environment.
*   Performance and security scans will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline at appropriate stages (e.g., nightly, pre-production).

## Positive Consequences

*   Higher quality software with fewer bugs in production.
*   Increased confidence in deploying changes frequently.
*   Faster feedback loops for developers.
*   Clear accountability for different types of testing.
*   Improved system resilience and performance.

## Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)

*   **Time Investment:** Writing and maintaining a comprehensive suite of automated tests requires significant upfront and ongoing effort.
    *   **Mitigation:** Prioritize testing critical paths. Provide training and good tooling. Foster a culture where testing is a shared responsibility.
*   **Test Environment Complexity:** Setting up and maintaining environments for different types of tests (especially E2E and performance) can be complex.
    *   **Mitigation:** Leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization, and service virtualization where possible. Use cloud-based testing services.
*   **Flaky Tests:** E2E tests, in particular, can be prone to flakiness.
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep E2E tests minimal and focused. Invest in robust test design and infrastructure. Implement retry mechanisms judiciously. Quarantine and fix flaky tests promptly.

*   Chaos engineering practices to test system resilience.
*   AI-assisted testing tools.

## Rejection Criteria

*   If the overhead of maintaining the full suite of tests demonstrably slows down development velocity to an unacceptable degree without a corresponding increase in quality or stability.
*   If the team lacks the skills or resources to effectively implement and maintain certain layers of testing, a more pragmatic, staged approach might be needed.

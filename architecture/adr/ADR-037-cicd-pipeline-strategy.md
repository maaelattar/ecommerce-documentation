# ADR-037: CI/CD Pipeline Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}} (Please update with current date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team, SRE/Ops Lead
*   **Consulted:** Lead Developers, Architects, QA Lead
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

To efficiently and reliably deliver our microservices-based e-commerce platform, we need a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This pipeline will automate the process of building, testing, and deploying services, enabling faster release cycles, improving code quality, and ensuring consistent deployments across different environments. 

This ADR defines the architecture, tools, and practices for our CI/CD strategy, supporting the goals outlined in previous ADRs related to deployment ([ADR-006](./ADR-006-cloud-native-deployment-strategy.md)), testing ([ADR-035](./ADR-035-comprehensive-testing-strategy.md)), and security ([ADR-036](./ADR-036-application-security-deep-dive.md)).

## Decision Drivers

*   **Automation:** Reduce manual effort and human error in build and deployment processes.
*   **Speed & Agility:** Enable rapid and frequent releases of new features and bug fixes.
*   **Reliability & Consistency:** Ensure that deployments are repeatable and predictable across all environments.
*   **Quality Improvement:** Integrate automated testing and security scans early in the development cycle.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Provide fast feedback to developers on code changes.
*   **Traceability:** Maintain a clear audit trail of what was deployed, when, and by whom.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Decentralized/Manual CI/CD

*   **Description:** Each service team manages its own build and deployment scripts, possibly with significant manual steps, or uses disparate CI/CD tools.
*   **Pros:** Flexibility for individual teams.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Inconsistent processes and tooling.
    *   High risk of human error.
    *   Slow release cycles.
    *   Difficult to enforce quality gates (testing, security) uniformly.
    *   Poor visibility and traceability across the platform.

### Option 2: Standardized, Automated CI/CD Platform

*   **Description:** Implement a centralized CI/CD platform with standardized pipeline templates and practices for all microservices. Emphasize automation at every stage.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Consistent and reliable build and deployment processes.
    *   Faster release cycles through automation.
    *   Improved quality via integrated, automated testing and security scans.
    *   Better visibility, control, and traceability.
    *   Easier to manage and scale.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires upfront investment in platform setup and pipeline definition.
    *   May require some initial learning for teams to adopt standardized practices.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** **Standardized, Automated CI/CD Platform**

We will implement a standardized, automated CI/CD platform, primarily leveraging GitHub Actions, to manage the build, test, and deployment lifecycle of our microservices.

**Reasoning:**

A standardized and automated CI/CD pipeline is fundamental to achieving the agility, reliability, and quality required for a modern e-commerce platform. GitHub Actions offers tight integration with our source code management, a rich ecosystem of actions, and robust capabilities for building complex workflows. This approach will ensure consistency, reduce manual toil, and enable us to release features and fixes rapidly and safely.

## CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

### Core Pipeline Stages

A typical pipeline for a microservice will include the following stages:

1.  **Checkout Code:**
    *   Triggered on commits/merges to specific branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`, feature branches for PRs).
    *   Fetches the latest source code from the GitHub repository.

2.  **Build & Package:**
    *   Compile code (if necessary for the language, e.g., TypeScript to JavaScript).
    *   Run linters and formatters ([ADR-031](./ADR-031-code-quality-static-analysis-review-standards.md)).
    *   Build a Docker container image for the service ([ADR-006](./ADR-006-cloud-native-deployment-strategy.md)).
    *   Tag the Docker image appropriately (e.g., with Git commit SHA, branch name, semantic version).

3.  **Automated Testing ([ADR-035](./ADR-035-comprehensive-testing-strategy.md))**:
    *   **Unit Tests:** Execute comprehensive unit tests.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Run intra-service integration tests.
    *   **Contract Tests (Consumer-Side):** Run consumer-driven contract tests against provider stubs/mocks.
    *   (Pipeline may publish provider contracts if applicable).

4.  **Security Scans ([ADR-036](./ADR-036-application-security-deep-dive.md))**:
    *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Analyze code for potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

5.  **Publish Artifacts:**
    *   Push the tagged Docker image to a designated Container Registry (e.g., GitHub Packages, AWS ECR, Google GCR).
    *   Publish test reports and code coverage reports.

6.  **Deploy to Environment:**
    *   Deploy the Docker image to the target Kubernetes environment ([ADR-006](./ADR-006-cloud-native-deployment-strategy.md)) using `kubectl` apply with Kustomize, or Helm charts.
    *   This stage will be parameterized or have separate workflows for different environments (Dev, Staging, Production).

7.  **Post-Deployment Verification:**
    *   **Health Checks:** Verify that the deployed service is running and healthy.
    *   **Smoke Tests:** Run a small suite of critical E2E or API tests against the newly deployed service in the environment.

### Branching Strategy Integration

*   **Feature Branches:** CI runs (build, lint, unit/integration tests, security scans) on every push to a feature branch and on Pull Request creation/update.
*   **`develop` Branch (or `main` if using GitHub Flow):** After PR merge, a full CI pipeline runs, including deployment to a `Development` or `Integration` environment.
*   **`release/*` Branches (if using GitFlow) or tags on `main`:** Trigger deployment to a `Staging` environment for UAT and further testing.
*   **`main` Branch / Git Tags:** Trigger deployment to the `Production` environment, potentially with manual approval gates.

### Tooling

*   **Source Code Management:** GitHub.
*   **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions.
*   **Container Registry:** GitHub Packages (initially, can be re-evaluated for specific cloud provider registries like ECR/GCR if cost/features dictate).
*   **Build Tools:** Docker, Node.js/NPM/Yarn, NestJS CLI, language-specific build tools.
*   **Testing Tools:** Jest, Pact, Cypress, k6, etc. (as per [ADR-035](./ADR-035-comprehensive-testing-strategy.md)).
*   **Deployment Tools:** `kubectl`, Kustomize, Helm.
*   **Security Scanning Tools:** Integrated GitHub security features (Dependabot), Snyk (or similar), linters with security plugins.

### Environment Promotion Strategy

*   **Development Environment:** Automated deployment on merge to `develop` (or `main` for GitHub Flow).
*   **Staging Environment:** Automated or manually triggered deployment from `develop` or `release` branches/tags. Used for UAT, full E2E testing, and performance testing.
*   **Production Environment:** Manually triggered deployment from a stable `main` branch tag or `release` branch merge. Requires explicit approval (e.g., GitHub Actions environments with approvers).

### Rollback Strategy

*   **Automated Rollback:** If post-deployment verification (smoke tests) fails, the pipeline should ideally trigger an automated rollback to the previous stable version.
*   **Manual Rollback:** Provide clear instructions and scripts/tooling to manually roll back to a previous version if issues are detected post-deployment.
*   Leverage Kubernetes deployment strategies (e.g., Blue/Green, Canary - future consideration) to minimize rollback impact.

### Monitoring and Feedback

*   CI/CD pipeline status will be visible in GitHub Actions.
*   Notifications (e.g., Slack, email) for build failures, deployment status, and critical test failures.
*   Dashboarding for pipeline metrics (e.g., build duration, success/failure rates).

## Positive Consequences

*   Faster and more reliable software delivery.
*   Improved code quality through automated checks.
*   Increased developer productivity by automating repetitive tasks.
*   Consistent deployment process across all services and environments.
*   Enhanced visibility and traceability of changes.

## Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)

*   **Initial Setup Complexity:** Defining and implementing standardized pipelines requires upfront effort.
    *   **Mitigation:** Start with a core reusable workflow and incrementally add features. Provide templates and documentation for service teams.
*   **Pipeline Maintenance:** CI/CD pipelines themselves require maintenance and updates.
    *   **Mitigation:** Treat pipeline code as production code (version control, reviews). Dedicate resources or a platform team for managing shared CI/CD infrastructure.
*   **Resource Consumption:** CI/CD jobs consume compute resources.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize pipelines for efficiency. Use self-hosted runners if cost with GitHub-hosted runners becomes an issue, or leverage cloud provider CI/CD services with potentially better cost structures for heavy use.
*   **Potential Bottleneck:** A centralized system can become a bottleneck if not managed well.
    *   **Mitigation:** Design for concurrency. Ensure the CI/CD platform can scale. Empower teams to manage their service-specific pipeline configurations within the standard framework.

## Future Considerations

*   Implementation of advanced deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary) managed by the pipeline.
*   GitOps for managing Kubernetes deployments (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux).
*   Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning testing or CI/CD environments.
*   Centralized dashboard for DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, etc.).

## Rejection Criteria

*   If the chosen CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions) proves to have significant limitations or cost implications that outweigh its benefits for our specific needs.
*   If the standardized pipeline approach becomes too rigid and hinders innovation or specific service requirements excessively.

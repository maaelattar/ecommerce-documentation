# ADR: Service Mesh & Network Policy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-12
*   **Deciders:** [Architecture Team]
*   **Consulted:** [DevOps, Security]
*   **Informed:** [All Engineering Teams]

## Context and Problem Statement

As the system grows, secure and observable service-to-service communication is critical. Without a service mesh, enforcing security, traffic management, and observability across microservices is inconsistent and error-prone.

## Decision Drivers
*   Security (mTLS, policy enforcement)
*   Observability and traffic management
*   Platform consistency and scalability
*   Decoupling network concerns from application code

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Adopt a Service Mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd)
*   Description: Use a service mesh to provide mTLS, traffic management, and observability for all Kubernetes services.
*   Pros:
    *   Consistent security and policy enforcement
    *   Advanced traffic management (A/B, canary, retries)
    *   Built-in observability
*   Cons:
    *   Additional operational complexity
    *   Learning curve for teams

### Option 2: Manual Network Policy and Security
*   Description: Use Kubernetes network policies and custom scripts for security and traffic management.
*   Pros:
    *   Simpler initial setup
    *   No extra components
*   Cons:
    *   Harder to scale and maintain
    *   Inconsistent enforcement
    *   Limited observability

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Adopt a Service Mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd)

**Reasoning:**
A service mesh provides a unified, scalable, and secure way to manage service-to-service communication. It enables advanced traffic management and observability, which are difficult to achieve with manual approaches. The operational overhead is justified by the security and reliability benefits.

### Positive Consequences
*   Enhanced security and observability
*   Simplified traffic management
*   Platform consistency

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   Additional operational complexity (Mitigation: Provide training and automation)
*   Learning curve (Mitigation: Use documentation and phased rollout)

### Neutral Consequences
*   May require updates to existing service manifests

## Future Considerations (Optional)
*   Evaluate mesh alternatives as the ecosystem evolves
*   Integrate mesh telemetry with observability stack

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)
*   If mesh overhead outweighs benefits, reconsider or simplify mesh usage

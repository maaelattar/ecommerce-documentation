*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11 (User to confirm/update actual decision date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** (N/A - DevOps/Platform Engineering if available)
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

The e-commerce platform, designed as a microservices architecture, requires a deployment strategy that supports scalability, resilience, automated management, and efficient resource utilization. The chosen strategy must align with cloud-native principles to leverage the benefits of cloud computing effectively. This ADR outlines the decision for the primary deployment model for the platform's microservices.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Scalability & Elasticity:** Ability to scale services up or down based on demand, automatically or manually.
*   **Resilience & High Availability:** Ensure services remain available during failures through self-healing, redundancy, and automated recovery.
*   **Resource Efficiency:** Optimize the use of underlying compute resources.
*   **Developer Productivity & CI/CD:** Streamline the build, test, and deployment pipeline. Enable consistent environments from development to production.
*   **Portability & Vendor Neutrality:** Minimize lock-in to specific cloud provider services where feasible, allowing for potential multi-cloud or hybrid scenarios (though a primary cloud provider will be chosen initially).
*   **Ecosystem & Community Support:** Leverage mature, well-supported technologies with a strong community.
*   **Observability & Management:** Facilitate monitoring, logging, tracing, and overall management of deployed services.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Containers (Docker) + Orchestration (Kubernetes) on a Major Cloud Provider

*   **Description:** Package applications as Docker containers and deploy them on a Kubernetes cluster managed by a major cloud provider (e.g., Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS).
*   **Pros:**
    *   **De Facto Standard for Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes offers powerful features for deployment, scaling, self-healing, service discovery, and configuration management.
    *   **Portability:** Containers and Kubernetes definitions are largely portable across environments and cloud providers.
    *   **Strong Ecosystem & Community:** Vast tooling and community support.
    *   **Resource Efficiency:** Efficient bin-packing of applications onto nodes.
    *   **Declarative Configuration:** Define desired state, and Kubernetes works to achieve it.
    *   **Excellent for Microservices:** Designed to manage complex, distributed applications.
    *   **Managed Kubernetes Services:** Cloud providers significantly reduce the operational overhead of managing Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Complexity:** Kubernetes has a steep learning curve, even with managed services.
    *   **Operational Overhead:** While managed services help, some level of Kubernetes expertise is still required for effective operation and troubleshooting.
    *   **Resource Intensive for Small Deployments:** Can be overkill for very small applications, though this platform is not small.

### Option 2: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

*   **Description:** Deploy applications directly to a PaaS offering (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine Standard/Flexible). The platform abstracts away much of the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Simplicity & Developer Productivity:** Greatly simplifies deployment and management. Developers focus more on code.
    *   **Managed Scaling & Infrastructure:** PaaS handles much of the scaling, load balancing, and infrastructure maintenance.
    *   **Faster Time to Market for Simpler Apps.**
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Less Control & Flexibility:** More opinionated, can be restrictive if advanced configurations or specific infrastructure access is needed.
    *   **Potential Vendor Lock-in:** PaaS offerings are often specific to a cloud provider or platform.
    *   **Cost:** Can become expensive at scale compared to IaaS or container orchestration for some workloads.
    *   **Debugging & Observability:** Can sometimes be more opaque than having direct access to containers and orchestration layers.

### Option 3: Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) as Primary Model

*   **Description:** Re-architect all or most microservices as individual functions deployed to a serverless platform. Pay-per-invocation model.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Extreme Scalability & No Infrastructure Management:** Scales automatically from zero to very high loads.
    *   **Cost-Effective for Event-Driven/Sporadic Workloads:** Pay only for what you use.
    *   **Simplified Deployment for Individual Functions.**
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Architectural Constraints:** Best suited for event-driven, stateless functions. Complex stateful applications or long-running processes can be challenging.
    *   **Cold Starts:** Can introduce latency.
    *   **Limited Execution Duration & Resource Constraints:** Functions have limits on execution time, memory, etc.
    *   **Vendor Lock-in:** Highly specific to cloud provider's serverless offerings.
    *   **Local Development & Testing Complexity:** Can be more complex to replicate the cloud environment locally.
    *   **"Function Chaining" Complexity:** Managing complex workflows across many functions can become intricate. Not all microservices fit this model well.

### Option 4: Traditional Virtual Machine (VM)-Based Deployment

*   **Description:** Deploy applications onto VMs, managing the OS, dependencies, and application lifecycle manually or with configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef).
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Maximum Control:** Full control over the environment.
    *   **Mature Technology:** Well-understood by traditional operations teams.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **High Operational Overhead:** Requires significant effort for provisioning, configuration, patching, scaling, and maintenance.
    *   **Lower Resource Efficiency:** Compared to containers.
    *   **Slower Deployments & Scaling.**
    *   **Less Resilience & Self-Healing:** Compared to orchestrated containers.
    *   **Inconsistent Environments:** Higher risk of configuration drift between environments.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Containers (Docker) + Orchestration (Kubernetes) on a Major Cloud Provider.

**Reasoning:**
The combination of Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration provides the best balance of scalability, resilience, portability, and ecosystem support for a cloud-native microservices platform.
*   **Docker** provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.
*   **Kubernetes** offers robust capabilities for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. Its features like self-healing, service discovery, load balancing, and declarative configuration are essential for managing a complex microservices landscape.
*   Utilizing a **managed Kubernetes service** (e.g., EKS, GKE, AKS) from a major cloud provider significantly reduces the operational burden of setting up and maintaining the Kubernetes control plane, allowing the team to focus more on application development and deployment.

This strategy aligns with the "Cloud-Native" and "Container-Based" guiding principles. While there is a learning curve associated with Kubernetes, its benefits in terms of operational efficiency and scalability at scale outweigh this for a platform of this nature. Serverless functions may still be used for specific, event-driven ancillary tasks, but Kubernetes will be the primary deployment platform for the core microservices.

### Positive Consequences
*   Enhanced scalability and elasticity of services.
*   Improved resilience and high availability through automated self-healing and load balancing.
*   Consistent deployment environments from development to production.
*   Efficient resource utilization.
*   Access to a vast ecosystem of tools and community support for Kubernetes.
*   Enables advanced deployment strategies (e.g., blue/green, canary releases).
*   Reduced operational burden for the control plane when using managed Kubernetes.

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   **Kubernetes Complexity:** Requires specialized knowledge and has a learning curve.
    *   **Mitigation:** Invest in training for the team. Start with a managed Kubernetes service. Leverage Helm charts and other tools to simplify application deployment. Adopt GitOps practices.
*   **Resource Overhead for Small Clusters:** Kubernetes itself consumes resources.
    *   **Mitigation:** For initial development/testing, smaller node sizes or even local Kubernetes solutions (Minikube, Kind, K3s) can be used. For production, the scale of the e-commerce platform will justify the resource usage.
*   **Potential Cloud Provider Lock-in (for managed service features):** While Kubernetes itself is portable, specific managed service integrations might create some lock-in.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on standard Kubernetes APIs and features. Abstract cloud-specific configurations where possible. The core application workloads remain portable.

## Future Considerations

*   Selection of a specific major cloud provider and their managed Kubernetes offering.
*   Definition of CI/CD pipelines for building Docker images and deploying to Kubernetes.
*   Strategy for cluster monitoring, logging, and alerting.
*   Selection of an Ingress controller for managing external access to services.
*   Establishment of resource request/limit best practices for containers.
*   Consideration of service mesh technology (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for advanced traffic management, security, and observability as the system matures.

## Rejection Criteria

*   If the operational complexity and cost of managing Kubernetes (even a managed service) prove to be prohibitive for the team's size and expertise, and a simpler PaaS solution demonstrably meets all critical NFRs.
*   If a new, significantly simpler orchestration technology emerges that offers comparable benefits to Kubernetes with a much lower barrier to entry.

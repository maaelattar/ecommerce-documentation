# ADR-036: Application Security Deep Dive

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}} (Please update with current date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team, Security Lead
*   **Consulted:** Lead Developers, Architects, SRE/Ops Team
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

While [ADR-028: Identity and Access Management (IAM)](./ADR-028-identity-and-access-management.md) defines the strategy for user authentication and coarse-grained access control at the perimeter (API Gateway), and [ADR-016: Configuration Management Strategy](./ADR-016-configuration-management-strategy.md) covers how services access configuration and secrets, a comprehensive security posture requires addressing security concerns *within* each microservice. This includes how services authenticate and authorize requests from each other, how they handle user context, validate inputs, protect against common vulnerabilities, and manage their dependencies securely.

This ADR outlines the key principles and strategies for building secure applications, ensuring that security is an integral part of the development lifecycle for every microservice.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls.
*   **Protect Sensitive Data:** Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user and business data.
*   **Prevent Common Vulnerabilities:** Address known attack vectors (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
*   **Secure Inter-Service Communication:** Ensure that services can trust requests from other internal services.
*   **Compliance and Trust:** Meet regulatory requirements and build user trust.
*   **Developer Awareness:** Provide clear guidelines for developers to build secure code.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Ad-hoc Security Measures per Service

*   **Description:** Allow individual service teams to implement security measures as they see fit, without a central strategy beyond basic IAM.
*   **Pros:** Flexibility for teams.
*   **Cons:** 
    *   Inconsistent security posture across services.
    *   High risk of overlooked vulnerabilities.
    *   Difficult to audit and maintain.
    *   No unified approach to common problems like input validation or dependency management.

### Option 2: Standardized Application Security Framework and Practices

*   **Description:** Define a common set of security principles, practices, libraries, and tools to be used across all microservices. This includes guidelines for authentication, authorization, input validation, dependency management, etc.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Consistent and strong security posture.
    *   Reduced risk of common vulnerabilities through standardized controls.
    *   Easier to audit and maintain security across the platform.
    *   Shared knowledge and tooling can improve developer productivity in implementing security.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires upfront effort to define standards and select tools.
    *   May require some initial learning curve for developers.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** **Standardized Application Security Framework and Practices**

We will adopt a standardized approach to application security, establishing common guidelines, libraries, and practices for all microservices. This ensures a consistent and robust security posture across the platform.

**Reasoning:**

The security of our e-commerce platform is paramount. An ad-hoc approach is insufficient for a distributed system handling sensitive data. A standardized framework ensures that all services implement essential security controls consistently, reducing the overall risk profile and making it easier to manage and evolve our security practices. This aligns with the principle of "Security by Design."

## Key Application Security Strategies

1.  **Service-to-Service Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   **Mechanism:** OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow will be used for services to obtain access tokens to call other internal services.
    *   **Identity Provider:** The central IAM solution ([ADR-028](./ADR-028-identity-and-access-management.md)) will issue these service tokens.
    *   **Token Validation:** Services will validate JWTs (signature, issuer, audience, expiration) received from other services.
    *   **Authorization:** Fine-grained authorization within services can be based on scopes present in the service token or other service-specific roles/permissions.

2.  **User Request Authentication & Authorization (within Services):**
    *   **Token Propagation:** User identity (e.g., JWT obtained via API Gateway) will be securely propagated to downstream services that require it.
    *   **Token Validation:** Each service that consumes the user token MUST validate it (signature, issuer, audience, expiration).
    *   **Fine-Grained Authorization:** Services will implement their own logic for fine-grained access control based on user roles, permissions, or ownership of resources, often derived from the validated user token.

3.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Principle:** All external input (HTTP request bodies, query parameters, path parameters, headers, message queue payloads) MUST be validated against a strict schema before processing.
    *   **Tools:** Leverage built-in validation in frameworks like NestJS (e.g., `class-validator`, `class-transformer`). Define clear DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) with validation decorators.
    *   **Strategy:** Fail fast on invalid input. Sanitize inputs where appropriate (e.g., for display) but prioritize validation for rejection.

4.  **Output Encoding:**
    *   **Principle:** Data rendered in user interfaces or passed to other systems MUST be properly encoded to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, NoSQL injection).
    *   **Tools:** Use templating engines that provide auto-escaping by default. Use framework-provided utilities for specific encoding needs.
    *   **Contextual Encoding:** Apply encoding appropriate to the context (HTML body, HTML attribute, JavaScript, CSS, URL).

5.  **Secrets Management (Application Runtime):**
    *   Services will access runtime secrets (API keys for third parties, database credentials if not injected by orchestrator) via mechanisms defined in [ADR-016](./ADR-016-configuration-management-strategy.md), primarily Kubernetes Secrets possibly managed by a Sealed Secrets solution or HashiCorp Vault for more sensitive cases.
    *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in code or unencrypted configuration files.

6.  **Dependency Vulnerability Management:**
    *   **Scanning:** Automatically scan application dependencies for known vulnerabilities as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Tools:** Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check, or similar tools integrated into GitHub/CI.
    *   **Policy:** Define a policy for addressing vulnerabilities based on severity (e.g., critical and high vulnerabilities must be fixed within X days).
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies up-to-date.

7.  **Secure Coding Guidelines & Practices:**
    *   Adhere to established secure coding principles (e.g., OWASP Top 10, SANS CWE Top 25).
    *   **Least Privilege:** Services and processes should run with the minimum permissions necessary.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling ([ADR-032](./ADR-032-system-wide-error-handling-propagation.md)) that does not leak sensitive information.
    *   **Security Headers:** Configure appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`).
    *   **Logging & Monitoring:** Securely log relevant security events (ADR-010, ADR-017).

8.  **Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection (Application Level):**
    *   Implement rate limiting on sensitive or resource-intensive endpoints to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
    *   **Tools:** NestJS provides modules for rate limiting (e.g., `@nestjs/throttler`).

## Positive Consequences

*   Reduced attack surface and lower likelihood of security breaches.
*   Consistent application of security best practices across all services.
*   Increased confidence in the security posture of the platform.
*   Facilitates compliance with security standards and regulations.
*   Improved developer awareness of security concerns.

## Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)

*   **Development Overhead:** Implementing comprehensive security measures can add to development time and complexity.
    *   **Mitigation:** Provide clear guidelines, reusable libraries/modules for common security tasks (e.g., token validation). Automate security checks in CI/CD. Foster a security-aware culture.
*   **Performance Impact:** Some security measures (e.g., intensive validation, cryptographic operations) can have a minor performance impact.
    *   **Mitigation:** Choose efficient libraries and algorithms. Apply intensive checks judiciously. Performance test security-critical paths.
*   **Potential for Misconfiguration:** Complex security controls can be misconfigured.
    *   **Mitigation:** Thorough testing, code reviews focusing on security aspects, and regular security audits.

## Future Considerations

*   Selection of specific SAST/DAST tooling and integration into CI/CD.
*   Web Application Firewall (WAF) strategy at the edge.
*   Detailed incident response plan for security breaches.
*   Regular security training programs for developers.

## Rejection Criteria

*   If the chosen standardized controls prove to be overly restrictive and significantly hinder development velocity for common use cases without providing commensurate security benefits for those specific cases.
*   If a specific service has unique, extreme security requirements that cannot be met by the standard framework, requiring a specialized (but documented and approved) approach for that service.

# ADR-009: Caching Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11 (User to confirm/update actual decision date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** (N/A - Lead Developers, Architects if distinct)
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

The e-commerce platform, built on a microservices architecture (ADR-001), aims for high performance, scalability, and resilience. Many operations involve data retrieval that can be computationally expensive or frequently accessed. Repeatedly fetching the same data from source systems (databases, other services) can lead to increased latency, higher load on backend services, and increased operational costs. A comprehensive caching strategy is needed to mitigate these issues, improve user experience, and optimize resource utilization.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Performance Improvement:** Reduce response times for end-users and internal service-to-service communication.
*   **Scalability:** Reduce load on backend services and databases, allowing them to handle more concurrent users/requests.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Decrease an E-commerce Website's infrastructure costs associated with database load and network traffic.
*   **Availability & Resilience:** Serve stale data from cache during backend service outages for certain non-critical data, improving perceived availability.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Faster load times lead to better user satisfaction and engagement.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: No Explicit Caching Strategy

*   **Description:** Rely solely on default browser caching and whatever minimal caching might be provided by underlying frameworks or databases without a coordinated approach.
*   **Pros:** Simplest to implement initially.
*   **Cons:** Poor performance, limited scalability, high backend load, suboptimal user experience, missed cost-saving opportunities. Not viable for a production e-commerce platform.

### Option 2: Single-Layer Caching (e.g., Only Distributed Cache)

*   **Description:** Implement a single type of caching mechanism, for example, a distributed cache like Redis for all caching needs.
*   **Pros:** Simpler than multi-layered, provides significant benefits over no caching.
*   **Cons:** Not optimal for all types of data (e.g., static assets better served by CDN). Can still put significant load on the distributed cache if not used judiciously. Misses opportunities for caching closer to the user.

### Option 3: Multi-Layered Caching Strategy

*   **Description:** Employ various caching mechanisms at different layers of the architecture, each suited for specific types of data and access patterns. This includes:
    *   **Client-Side (Browser) Caching:** For static assets and user-specific, non-sensitive data.
    *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** For static assets (JS, CSS, images) and publicly cacheable API responses.
    *   **API Gateway Caching:** For caching responses from backend services at the API gateway level.
    *   **Distributed Cache (e.g., Redis):** For shared session data, frequently accessed query results, pre-computed data, rate limiting.
    *   **In-Memory Cache (Service-Level):** For very hot, small datasets specific to a service instance (e.g., configuration).
    *   **Database Caching:** Leveraging built-in database caching capabilities.
*   **Pros:** Most effective for performance and scalability. Optimizes resource use by caching data at the most appropriate layer. Provides defense in depth.
*   **Cons:** More complex to design, implement, and manage. Requires careful consideration of cache invalidation strategies across layers.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Multi-Layered Caching Strategy with Redis as a Primary Distributed Cache

**Reasoning:**
A multi-layered caching strategy provides the most comprehensive and effective approach to meet the performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency goals of the e-commerce platform. Each layer addresses specific needs:

1.  **Browser Cache:** Utilized for static assets (controlled by HTTP headers like `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Expires`) and potentially small, non-sensitive user-specific data.
2.  **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Mandatory for all static assets (images, JS, CSS) and highly recommended for publicly accessible, read-heavy API endpoints (e.g., product listings, categories, promotional content).
3.  **API Gateway Caching:** To be considered for frequently accessed, non-personalized API responses to reduce load on backend microservices. Configuration will be per-API endpoint.
4.  **Distributed Cache (Redis):** A managed Redis service will be the primary solution for shared, frequently accessed, and mutable data.
    *   **Use Cases:** User session data, cached results of expensive queries, pre-computed aggregates, shopping cart data (before persistence), rate limiting, feature flags.
    *   **Rationale for Redis:** High performance, versatile data structures, support for pub/sub (useful for cache invalidation), good ecosystem, and availability as a managed service.
5.  **In-Memory Cache (Service-Level):** Services can implement local in-memory caches (e.g., using libraries like `node-cache` for Node.js/NestJS) for extremely hot, small datasets like configuration parameters or frequently used metadata. Must be used judiciously with clear invalidation strategies, especially in multi-instance deployments.
6.  **Database Caching:** Services should leverage built-in caching mechanisms of their chosen databases (e.g., PostgreSQL's internal caches) but not rely on this as the primary caching layer for application-level performance.

**Cache Invalidation:** This is a critical aspect. Strategies will include:
*   **Time-To-Live (TTL):** Most common approach. Data expires after a set duration.
*   **Event-Driven Invalidation:** Services publish events (ADR-002) when underlying data changes (e.g., `ProductUpdated`, `InventoryChanged`). Other services or a dedicated cache invalidation service can subscribe to these events to evict relevant cache entries.
*   **Explicit Invalidation:** APIs to clear specific cache entries when data is known to have changed.

Services are responsible for defining their caching requirements, choosing appropriate cache layers from this strategy, and implementing cache population and invalidation logic. The platform team will provide access to and support for a managed CDN and a managed Redis cluster.

### Positive Consequences
*   Significant improvement in application performance and user experience.
*   Reduced load on backend services and databases, improving scalability and stability.
*   Potential reduction in infrastructure costs.
*   Increased resilience by serving stale data (where appropriate) during outages.

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   **Complexity:** Implementing and managing multi-layered caching, especially cache invalidation, can be complex.
    *   **Mitigation:** Clear guidelines, standardized libraries/approaches where possible. Robust monitoring of cache hit/miss rates and data staleness. Start with simpler TTL-based invalidation and introduce event-driven invalidation for critical data.
*   **Data Staleness:** Risk of serving outdated data if cache invalidation is not effective.
    *   **Mitigation:** Carefully choose TTLs based on data volatility. Implement robust invalidation mechanisms. Provide mechanisms for users to force-refresh data where critical. Monitor data consistency.
*   **Increased Infrastructure:** CDN costs, cost of managed Redis service.
    *   **Mitigation:** These costs are generally offset by savings in backend compute and database resources, and improved user conversion. Optimize cache usage.
*   **Debugging Challenges:** Tracing requests through multiple caching layers can be harder.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement correlation IDs and comprehensive logging/tracing across layers.

*   Standardized libraries or modules for interacting with Redis and implementing service-level in-memory caches.
*   Automated testing for cache consistency and invalidation logic.

## Rejection Criteria

*   If the chosen strategy leads to unacceptable levels of data staleness for critical business functions.
*   If the operational complexity and cost outweigh the performance benefits for the majority of services.

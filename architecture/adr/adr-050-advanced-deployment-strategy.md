# ADR-050: Advanced Deployment Strategy

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-05-19

## 1. Context

As the e-commerce platform matures and handles more services and traffic, the need for safer and more sophisticated deployment strategies becomes critical. The current CI/CD pipeline (ADR-012, ADR-037) supports basic automated deployments. This ADR explores advanced deployment strategies like Blue/Green, Canary Releases, or Rolling Updates with more control, aiming to minimize downtime, reduce risk, and allow for progressive rollout of new features/versions.

Milestone 2, Sprint 3 includes a PBI (PBI-M2-3.5) to research and pilot an advanced deployment strategy for one service as a Proof of Concept (PoC).

## 2. Decision Drivers

*   **Minimize Downtime:** Ensure new deployments do not interrupt service availability.
*   **Reduce Risk:** Limit the blast radius of problematic deployments.
*   **Rapid Rollback:** Enable quick and reliable rollback to a stable version if issues are detected.
*   **Progressive Exposure:** Allow new versions to be tested with a subset of traffic/users before full rollout.
*   **Developer/Operational Efficiency:** Streamline the deployment process while providing better control.
*   **Resource Utilization:** Consider the infrastructure overhead of different strategies.
*   **Alignment with Kubernetes:** Leverage Kubernetes capabilities (e.g., Deployments, Services, Ingress) and potentially service mesh features (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for traffic management.

## 3. Considered Options

### Option 1: Enhanced Rolling Updates (Kubernetes Default)
*   *Description:* Gradually replace old pods with new ones. Kubernetes Services manage traffic distribution.
*   *Pros:* Built-in Kubernetes feature, simple to configure, zero-downtime if `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` are set correctly.
*   *Cons:* Rollback is essentially a new rollout of the old version. No easy way to test new version with a subset of live traffic before full rollout. Blast radius can still be significant if issues appear late in the rollout.

### Option 2: Blue/Green Deployment
*   *Description:* Maintain two identical environments: Blue (current live) and Green (new version). Switch traffic from Blue to Green once Green is verified. Blue becomes standby/rollback target.
*   *Pros:* Instant rollback by switching traffic back to Blue. New version fully tested in an identical environment before taking live traffic.
*   *Cons:* Requires double the infrastructure resources (or careful management if resources are dynamically provisioned). Can be complex to manage stateful applications or database migrations.

### Option 3: Canary Releases
*   *Description:* Route a small percentage of live traffic to the new version (Canary). Monitor performance and errors. Gradually increase traffic to Canary if stable, or roll back if issues arise.
*   *Pros:* Low-risk exposure of new version. Real user feedback on new version. Fine-grained control over rollout.
*   *Cons:* More complex to set up and manage traffic routing (often requires a service mesh like Istio/Linkerd or advanced Ingress controller). Requires robust monitoring and automated analysis to detect issues in Canary.

### Option 4: A/B Testing (as a deployment strategy variant)
*   *Description:* Similar to Canary, but traffic is routed based on specific user segments or attributes, often to test different features rather than just stability. Can be used for feature flagging during deployment.
*   *Pros:* Allows testing specific features with targeted audiences.
*   *Cons:* Even more complex traffic management and analysis. More of a feature experimentation tool than a pure deployment safety mechanism, but related.

## 4. Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** [To be decided - Phased approach recommended. Start with mastering **Enhanced Rolling Updates**, then pilot **Canary Releases** for critical services, potentially using **Blue/Green** for major version upgrades or high-risk changes where infrastructure cost is less of a concern for the switchover period.]

Rationale for Phased Approach:
*   **Start Simple, Evolve:** Ensure robust Rolling Updates are consistently achieved first.
*   **Canary for Risk Mitigation:** Canary releases offer the best balance of risk mitigation and progressive exposure for frequently updated microservices.
*   **Blue/Green for Major Changes:** Useful for larger, less frequent updates where a full environment test is beneficial.
*   The PoC in M2S3 will focus on **Canary Releases** for a selected service using Kubernetes and potentially a service mesh or advanced Ingress.

## 5. Implementation Details (Focus on Canary for PoC)

*   **Tooling:**
    *   Kubernetes Deployments and Services.
    *   Service Mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) or Advanced Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX Ingress with canary capabilities, Traefik) for fine-grained traffic splitting.
    *   CI/CD pipeline integration (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions - ADR-012) to orchestrate the canary deployment steps.
    *   Monitoring & Alerting tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager - ADR-011, ADR-021) to observe canary performance.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Deploy the new version (Canary) alongside the stable version.
    2.  Configure traffic routing to send a small percentage (e.g., 1%, 5%) of traffic to the Canary.
    3.  Monitor key metrics (error rates, latency, business KPIs) for both Canary and stable versions.
    4.  If Canary is stable, gradually increase traffic.
    5.  If issues detected, roll back by routing all traffic to the stable version and removing the Canary.
    6.  Once Canary handles 100% of traffic and is stable, promote it to be the new stable version.
*   **Automated Analysis:** Explore tools or scripts to automatically compare Canary metrics against stable version metrics to aid in go/no-go decisions.

## 6. Pros and Cons of the Decision (Phased approach with Canary PoC)

### Pros
*   Iterative improvement of deployment safety.
*   Canary provides real-world testing with limited risk.
*   Aligns with modern DevOps and SRE practices.

### Cons
*   Canary releases add complexity to the CI/CD pipeline and require mature monitoring.
*   Service mesh or advanced Ingress adds another layer to manage.

## 7. Consequences

*   Requires investment in learning and configuring traffic management tools.
*   Development teams need to be aware of how their services will be deployed and monitored in a canary fashion.
*   Monitoring becomes even more critical.

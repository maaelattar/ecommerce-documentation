# ADR-043: Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Strategy

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-05-12
- **Deciders:** CTO, Platform Engineering Lead, Cloud Operations Lead
- **Consulted:** Security Lead, Compliance, Service Owners
- **Informed:** All Engineering Teams, Product Management

## Context and Problem Statement

Relying on a single cloud provider can introduce risks such as vendor lock-in, regional outages, and compliance challenges. As the platform grows and expands globally, there may be business, regulatory, or technical reasons to support multi-cloud or hybrid cloud deployments, including data sovereignty, disaster recovery, and cost optimization.

## Decision Drivers

- Business continuity and disaster recovery
- Regulatory compliance and data sovereignty
- Vendor risk mitigation
- Flexibility and cost optimization

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Design for Multi-Cloud/Hybrid Cloud Flexibility

- Description: Architect the platform to support deployment across multiple cloud providers and/or on-premises environments, using cloud-agnostic tooling and abstractions where feasible.
- Pros:
  - Reduces vendor lock-in and outage risk
  - Supports regulatory and data residency requirements
  - Enables cost and performance optimization
- Cons:
  - Increased architectural and operational complexity
  - Potentially higher costs for abstraction layers

### Option 2: Single Cloud Provider (Status Quo)

- Description: Continue to use a single primary cloud provider for all workloads.
- Pros:
  - Simpler operations and tooling
  - Leverage provider-specific features
- Cons:
  - Vendor lock-in and regional risk
  - Limited flexibility for compliance or optimization

### Option 3: Selective Multi-Cloud (Critical Workloads Only)

- Description: Deploy only critical workloads or data to multiple clouds or hybrid environments as needed.
- Pros:
  - Balances complexity and risk
  - Focuses effort where most needed
- Cons:
  - Partial coverage of multi-cloud benefits
  - Still some operational complexity

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Design for Multi-Cloud/Hybrid Cloud Flexibility

**Reasoning:**
Designing for multi-cloud and hybrid cloud flexibility provides the greatest long-term resilience, compliance, and business agility. While it introduces complexity, it enables the platform to meet global requirements and adapt to changing business or regulatory needs.

### Positive Consequences

- Improved business continuity and disaster recovery
- Greater compliance with data sovereignty laws
- Reduced vendor risk and increased negotiation leverage

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)

- Increased complexity (Mitigation: use cloud-agnostic tools, automation, and clear documentation)
- Potentially higher costs (Mitigation: evaluate ROI and optimize abstraction layers)

### Neutral Consequences

- May influence technology and vendor selection

## Future Considerations (Optional)

- Evaluate emerging multi-cloud management platforms
- Monitor regulatory changes and update strategy as needed
- Consider hybrid cloud for edge or on-premises use cases

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)

- If multi-cloud complexity outweighs benefits for current business needs, revisit the approach

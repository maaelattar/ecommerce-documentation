# ADR-040: Platform Engineering & Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Strategy

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-05-12
- **Deciders:** Platform Engineering Lead, CTO, SRE Lead
- **Consulted:** DevOps Team, Service Owners
- **Informed:** All Engineering Teams, Product Management

## Context and Problem Statement

As the platform grows in complexity and scale, ensuring reliability, operational excellence, and developer productivity becomes increasingly critical. Platform Engineering and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices are essential to provide a robust foundation for service teams, streamline operations, and maintain high service levels. The current state lacks a formalized approach to platform engineering and SRE, which can lead to inconsistent reliability, duplicated tooling, and slower developer onboarding.

## Decision Drivers

- Reliability and uptime (SLOs/SLIs)
- Developer productivity and self-service
- Operational efficiency and automation
- Scalability and consistency across teams

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Establish Dedicated Platform Engineering & SRE Function

- Description: Create a dedicated team responsible for platform tooling, paved road, SRE practices, and reliability engineering.
- Pros:
  - Consistent tooling and automation
  - Clear ownership of reliability and platform concerns
  - Faster onboarding and improved developer experience
- Cons:
  - Requires investment in new roles and resources
  - Potential for bottlenecks if not well-staffed

### Option 2: Decentralized Approach (Each Team Owns Platform/SRE)

- Description: Each service team is responsible for its own platform tooling and reliability practices.
- Pros:
  - Maximum autonomy for teams
  - Potential for innovation in tooling
- Cons:
  - Duplication of effort
  - Inconsistent reliability and developer experience
  - Harder to enforce standards

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Central Guidance, Team Execution)

- Description: Central team sets standards and provides reusable components, but service teams implement SRE practices.
- Pros:
  - Balance of consistency and autonomy
  - Shared responsibility
- Cons:
  - Still risk of inconsistency
  - Requires strong communication and alignment

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Establish Dedicated Platform Engineering & SRE Function

**Reasoning:**
A dedicated function ensures consistent, scalable, and reliable platform capabilities, accelerates developer onboarding, and provides clear accountability for reliability. This approach best addresses the need for operational excellence and supports rapid business growth.

### Positive Consequences

- Improved reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency
- Faster onboarding and higher developer productivity
- Clear accountability and transparency for service reliability

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)

- Investment required in platform engineering resources and tooling (Mitigation: phased hiring and automation)
- Potential bottlenecks (Mitigation: maintain strong feedback loops and empower self-service)

### Neutral Consequences

- Some teams may need to adjust to new workflows and standards

## Future Considerations (Optional)

- Expand self-service capabilities
- Regularly review and evolve platform tooling
- Monitor SLOs and error budgets for continuous improvement

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)

- If the dedicated function becomes a bottleneck or fails to deliver value, consider a hybrid or decentralized approach

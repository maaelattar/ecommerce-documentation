# ADR-019: Authentication and Authorization Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** Security Team, Lead Developers
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

With a microservices architecture (ADR-001), securing inter-service communication and user access to APIs is critical. We need a consistent and robust strategy for authenticating entities (users, services) and authorizing their access to specific resources and operations. This strategy must integrate seamlessly with our API Gateway (ADR-014) and individual services.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Security:** Strong protection against unauthorized access and data breaches.
*   **Scalability:** Solution must scale with the number of users and services.
*   **Interoperability:** Standard-based approach for easier integration across diverse services and clients.
*   **User Experience:** Minimize friction for legitimate users while maintaining security.
*   **Developer Experience:** Clear guidelines and libraries for service developers to implement security.
*   **Centralized Management:** Preferable to have a central point for identity and access policy management.

## Considered Options

1.  **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: Industry-standard protocols for delegation of authorization and authentication.
2.  **Custom Token-Based Solution**: Develop a proprietary token generation and validation mechanism.
3.  **API Keys**: Simple mechanism, primarily for server-to-server authentication.
4.  **SAML**: Another standard, often used in enterprise SSO, but can be more complex for microservices.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

*   **Authentication:** OpenID Connect will be used to authenticate users. An external Identity Provider (IdP) compatible with OIDC (e.g., Keycloak, Auth0, Okta, or a custom build if necessary) will manage user identities and issue ID Tokens and Access Tokens (JWTs).
*   **Authorization:** OAuth 2.0 will be used for authorization. Access Tokens (JWTs) will carry scopes and potentially roles/permissions.
    *   **User-to-Service:** Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for public clients (e.g., web/mobile frontends).
    *   **Service-to-Service (M2M):** Client Credentials Flow for backend services.
*   **Token Format:** JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) will be used for ID Tokens and Access Tokens. These tokens will be signed and potentially encrypted.
*   **API Gateway Role:** The API Gateway (ADR-014) will be responsible for:
    *   Enforcing authentication for incoming requests.
    *   Validating JWTs (signature, expiration, issuer, audience).
    *   Potentially offloading initial OIDC flows.
    *   Forwarding user identity (e.g., user ID from token claims) to upstream services.
*   **Service-Level Authorization:** Individual microservices will be responsible for fine-grained authorization based on the validated JWT claims (e.g., user ID, roles, scopes, permissions) and business logic. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and/or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) models will be implemented within services as needed.
*   **Token Revocation:** Mechanisms for token revocation (e.g., short-lived tokens, revocation lists) will be implemented.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   Standardized, widely adopted, and secure approach.
    *   Enables Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities.
    *   Clear separation of concerns (IdP for authentication, services for authorization).
    *   Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.
    *   Facilitates integration with third-party clients and services.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires selection, setup, and management of an Identity Provider.
    *   Can be complex to implement correctly initially.
    *   JWTs, if large, can add overhead to requests.
    *   Services must be able to validate JWTs and extract relevant claims.
*   **Risks:**
    *   Misconfiguration of OAuth 2.0/OIDC flows or IdP can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    *   Compromise of token signing keys would be critical.

## Compliance

*   Follow JWT best practices (e.g., use strong algorithms like RS256, validate `alg` header, `aud`, `iss`, `exp` claims).
*   Securely store client secrets and signing keys (e.g., using Kubernetes Secrets and potentially HashiCorp Vault - ADR-016).

## Next Steps

*   Select and configure an Identity Provider.
*   Define standard JWT claims structure.
*   Develop libraries/middleware for services to easily integrate with the authentication/authorization scheme.
*   Update API Gateway configuration to enforce JWT validation.

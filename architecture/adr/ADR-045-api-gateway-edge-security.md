# ADR: API Gateway & Edge Security

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-12
*   **Deciders:** [Architecture Team, Security]
*   **Consulted:** [DevOps, Product Owners]
*   **Informed:** [All Engineering Teams]

## Context and Problem Statement

API gateways are the single entry point for clients and enforce security, routing, and rate limiting at the edge. Without a robust gateway and edge security, backend services are exposed to threats, inconsistent policy enforcement, and compliance risks.

## Decision Drivers
*   Security and compliance
*   Centralized policy enforcement
*   Simplified client integration
*   DDoS and abuse protection

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Use a Dedicated API Gateway (Kong, NGINX, AWS API Gateway)
*   Description: Route all external traffic through a dedicated API gateway, enforcing authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and DDoS protection.
*   Pros:
    *   Improved security posture
    *   Centralized management and monitoring
    *   Supports advanced features (WAF, geo-blocking)
*   Cons:
    *   Additional operational complexity
    *   Requires configuration and maintenance

### Option 2: Direct Service Exposure with Basic Load Balancer
*   Description: Expose services directly via a load balancer, with minimal security and routing logic.
*   Pros:
    *   Simpler setup
    *   Lower initial cost
*   Cons:
    *   Higher risk of security breaches
    *   Inconsistent policy enforcement
    *   Limited monitoring and analytics

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Use a Dedicated API Gateway (Kong, NGINX, AWS API Gateway)

**Reasoning:**
A dedicated API gateway provides robust security, centralized policy enforcement, and advanced features needed for modern ecommerce. The operational overhead is justified by the risk reduction and compliance benefits.

### Positive Consequences
*   Improved security and compliance
*   Simplified client integration
*   Centralized monitoring and analytics

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   Additional operational complexity (Mitigation: Use configuration as code and automation)
*   Requires ongoing maintenance (Mitigation: Regular reviews and updates)

### Neutral Consequences
*   May require migration from legacy ingress/load balancer setups

## Future Considerations (Optional)
*   Integrate API gateway with observability and incident response
*   Expand use of WAF and advanced security features

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)
*   If gateway complexity or cost outweighs benefits, reconsider or simplify approach

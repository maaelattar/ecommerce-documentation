# ADR-027: Scalability and Performance Testing Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11
*   **Deciders:** Project Team, QA Team
*   **Consulted:** Lead Developers, DevOps/SRE Team
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

Our e-commerce platform must handle varying loads, especially during peak shopping seasons or promotional events, while maintaining responsiveness and stability. This ADR outlines the strategy for conducting scalability and performance testing to ensure our microservices (ADR-001) and the overall system can meet defined performance targets and scale efficiently. This complements the general testing strategy (ADR-013) by focusing specifically on non-functional performance aspects.

## Decision Drivers

*   **User Experience:** Ensure fast response times and system availability under load.
*   **System Stability:** Prevent crashes or degradation when load increases.
*   **Scalability:** Verify the system can scale horizontally and/or vertically to meet demand.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize resource utilization to control costs.
*   **Capacity Planning:** Understand current capacity limits and inform future scaling needs.
*   **Confidence in Releases:** Ensure new changes do not degrade performance or scalability.

## Considered Types of Performance Testing

1.  **Load Testing:** Assess system behavior under expected peak load conditions.
2.  **Stress Testing:** Evaluate system behavior beyond normal operating limits to find its breaking point and how it recovers.
3.  **Soak Testing (Endurance Testing):** Test system stability and resource consumption over an extended period under normal load.
4.  **Spike Testing:** Analyze system response to sudden, short bursts of very high load.
5.  **Volume Testing:** Test the system with large amounts of data in databases or large numbers of concurrent users/requests.
6.  **Scalability Testing:** Determine how effectively the system scales up (or out) when resources are added.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Approach:** Implement a comprehensive performance testing strategy integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (ADR-012) for key services and end-to-end scenarios. This will involve a combination of Load, Stress, and Soak testing, primarily executed in a dedicated, production-like performance testing environment.

*   **Scope and Focus:**
    *   **Key User Journeys:** Prioritize testing of critical user flows (e.g., product browsing, search, add to cart, checkout, payment processing).
    *   **Critical Services:** Focus on services that are bottlenecks, handle high traffic, or are critical for core functionality.
    *   **API Performance:** Test performance of individual service APIs and the aggregated API Gateway (ADR-014) endpoints.

*   **Performance Testing Environment:**
    *   A dedicated, isolated performance testing environment that mirrors production as closely as possible in terms of infrastructure (Kubernetes - ADR-006), data volume (anonymized production-like data), and service configurations.

*   **Testing Tools:**
    *   Select appropriate open-source or commercial performance testing tools (e.g., k6, JMeter, Gatling, Locust, BlazeMeter, LoadRunner). The choice may depend on the specific protocols (HTTP, gRPC) and scripting capabilities required.
    *   Tools should support distributed load generation.

*   **Performance Metrics (KPIs):**
    *   Define clear, measurable performance targets for key services and user journeys. Examples:
        *   Response Time (average, 95th percentile, 99th percentile).
        *   Throughput (requests per second, transactions per second).
        *   Error Rate.
        *   Resource Utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O, disk I/O) of services and infrastructure.
        *   Scalability metrics (e.g., cost per transaction at scale).
    *   These metrics will be monitored using our centralized logging and monitoring solution (ADR-021).

*   **Test Scenarios and Execution:**
    *   **Automated Performance Tests:** Integrate performance tests into the CI/CD pipeline to run automatically (e.g., nightly, or before major releases) against the performance environment.
    *   **Baseline Testing:** Establish performance baselines for services and track regressions over time.
    *   **Load Testing:** Simulate expected peak load based on projections.
    *   **Stress Testing:** Gradually increase load beyond peak to identify breaking points and recovery behavior.
    *   **Soak Testing:** Run tests for extended periods (e.g., 8-24 hours) to detect memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or performance degradation over time.

*   **Analysis and Reporting:**
    *   Automated collection and aggregation of performance metrics.
    *   Generation of performance test reports highlighting KPIs, trends, bottlenecks, and pass/fail status against targets.
    *   Performance issues identified must be triaged, prioritized, and addressed by development teams.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   Increased confidence in the system's ability to handle production load.
    *   Early detection of performance bottlenecks and scalability issues.
    *   Improved user experience due to better performance and stability.
    *   Data-driven capacity planning.
    *   Helps optimize infrastructure costs.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires a dedicated, production-like performance testing environment, which can be costly to maintain.
    *   Developing and maintaining performance test scripts can be time-consuming.
    *   Performance testing tools can have a learning curve.
    *   Analyzing performance test results and identifying root causes of bottlenecks requires expertise.
*   **Risks:**
    *   Performance environment may not perfectly replicate production, leading to inaccurate results.
    *   Tests might not cover all critical scenarios or realistic user behavior.
    *   Performance bottlenecks might be in external dependencies not fully under our control or not replicated in the test environment.

## Next Steps

*   Provision and configure the dedicated performance testing environment.
*   Select and set up performance testing tools.
*   Define specific performance KPIs and targets for critical services and user journeys.
*   Develop initial performance test scripts for key scenarios.
*   Integrate automated performance tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Conduct initial baseline performance tests.
*   Establish a process for regular performance test execution, analysis, and issue remediation.

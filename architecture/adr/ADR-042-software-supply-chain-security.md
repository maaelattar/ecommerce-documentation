# ADR-042: Software Supply Chain Security Strategy

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-05-12
- **Deciders:** Security Lead, Platform Engineering Lead, DevOps Lead
- **Consulted:** Service Owners, Compliance, Cloud Operations
- **Informed:** All Engineering Teams, Product Management

## Context and Problem Statement

Modern cloud native applications depend on a complex software supply chain, including open source dependencies, container images, CI/CD pipelines, and third-party integrations. This introduces risks such as dependency vulnerabilities, compromised images, and untrusted code. A formal supply chain security strategy is needed to protect the platform and customers from these threats.

## Decision Drivers

- Security and integrity of software artifacts
- Regulatory and compliance requirements
- Customer trust and brand reputation
- Operational risk reduction

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Comprehensive Supply Chain Security Controls

- Description: Implement SBOMs, image signing, vulnerability scanning, dependency management, and CI/CD hardening as standard practices.
- Pros:
  - Strong protection against supply chain attacks
  - Improved compliance and auditability
  - Early detection of vulnerabilities
- Cons:
  - Additional process and tooling overhead
  - Requires ongoing maintenance and updates

### Option 2: Minimal Controls (Basic Scanning Only)

- Description: Rely on basic vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines.
- Pros:
  - Low overhead
- Cons:
  - Limited protection and visibility
  - Higher risk of undetected threats

### Option 3: Outsource to Third-Party Security Vendors

- Description: Use external vendors for supply chain security monitoring and enforcement.
- Pros:
  - Expert management and automation
- Cons:
  - Additional costs
  - Potential vendor lock-in

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Comprehensive Supply Chain Security Controls

**Reasoning:**
A comprehensive, in-house approach provides the best balance of security, compliance, and operational control. It enables early detection and mitigation of risks, supports regulatory requirements, and builds customer trust.

### Positive Consequences

- Stronger protection against supply chain threats
- Improved compliance and audit readiness
- Increased customer and stakeholder confidence

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)

- Increased process/tooling overhead (Mitigation: automate as much as possible, provide developer training)
- Ongoing maintenance required (Mitigation: regular reviews and updates)

### Neutral Consequences

- May influence selection of build tools and registries

## Future Considerations (Optional)

- Monitor evolving supply chain threats and update controls
- Evaluate new standards and tools (e.g., in-toto, GUAC)
- Expand to cover all third-party integrations

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)

- If controls significantly impact developer velocity or critical business operations, revisit the approach

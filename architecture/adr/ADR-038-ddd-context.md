# ADR: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Context

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-12
*   **Deciders:** [Architecture Team]
*   **Consulted:** [Domain Experts, Product Owners]
*   **Informed:** [All Engineering Teams]

## Context and Problem Statement

The ecommerce platform spans multiple business domains (ordering, payments, inventory, customer management). Without clear boundaries, services risk becoming tightly coupled, leading to complexity and slow delivery. A structured approach is needed to manage business complexity and ensure scalable, maintainable microservices.

## Decision Drivers
*   Scalability and maintainability
*   Clear service boundaries and ownership
*   Alignment with business domains
*   Reduced coupling and improved team autonomy

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
*   Description: Use DDD principles to define bounded contexts, aggregates, and ubiquitous language. Map microservices to business domains.
*   Pros:
    *   Clear service boundaries
    *   Improved alignment with business
    *   Easier onboarding and maintenance
*   Cons:
    *   Requires upfront investment in modeling
    *   Learning curve for teams

### Option 2: Ad-hoc Service Design
*   Description: Allow teams to define services organically without formal boundaries or modeling.
*   Pros:
    *   Faster initial development
    *   Less process overhead
*   Cons:
    *   Risk of tightly coupled services
    *   Harder to scale and maintain
    *   Increased risk of duplicated logic

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Reasoning:**
DDD provides a proven framework for managing complexity in large systems. It enables clear service boundaries, aligns technical and business teams, and supports long-term scalability and maintainability. The upfront investment is justified by reduced technical debt and improved delivery speed over time.

### Positive Consequences
*   Improved clarity of service responsibilities
*   Better alignment between business and technical teams
*   Easier onboarding for new developers

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   Upfront modeling effort (Mitigation: Use event storming workshops and iterative refinement)
*   Learning curve (Mitigation: Provide training and documentation)

### Neutral Consequences
*   May require refactoring of existing services

## Future Considerations (Optional)
*   Review and update context maps as business evolves
*   Expand DDD practices to new domains as needed

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)
*   If DDD introduces excessive overhead without clear benefits, reconsider approach

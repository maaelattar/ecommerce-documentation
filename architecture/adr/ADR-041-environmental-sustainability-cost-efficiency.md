# ADR-041: Environmental Sustainability and Cost Efficiency Strategy

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-05-12
- **Deciders:** Platform Engineering Lead, CTO, Cloud Operations Lead
- **Consulted:** DevOps Team, Finance, Service Owners
- **Informed:** All Engineering Teams, Product Management

## Context and Problem Statement

Cloud native platforms can have significant energy and cost footprints, especially at scale. As sustainability and cost efficiency become business and societal priorities, it is important to adopt strategies that minimize environmental impact and optimize resource usage without compromising performance or reliability.

## Decision Drivers

- Cost efficiency and cloud spend optimization
- Environmental sustainability and carbon footprint reduction
- Regulatory and stakeholder expectations
- Operational efficiency

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Proactive Sustainability and Cost Optimization Practices

- Description: Implement cloud-native best practices for sustainability and cost efficiency, including autoscaling, serverless, right-sizing, green region selection, and continuous monitoring.
- Pros:
  - Reduced energy consumption and carbon footprint
  - Lower operational costs
  - Positive brand and compliance impact
- Cons:
  - Requires ongoing monitoring and optimization
  - May require changes to deployment and architecture patterns

### Option 2: Status Quo (No Explicit Sustainability Focus)

- Description: Continue with current practices, focusing only on performance and reliability.
- Pros:
  - No additional process overhead
- Cons:
  - Higher costs and energy usage
  - Missed sustainability and compliance opportunities

### Option 3: Third-Party Sustainability Tools/Partners

- Description: Use external tools or partners to monitor and optimize sustainability.
- Pros:
  - Expert insights and automation
- Cons:
  - Additional costs
  - Potential vendor lock-in

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Proactive Sustainability and Cost Optimization Practices

**Reasoning:**
Directly integrating sustainability and cost efficiency into platform engineering and operations aligns with business, regulatory, and societal goals. It provides long-term cost savings, reduces environmental impact, and supports compliance and brand reputation.

### Positive Consequences

- Lower cloud spend and operational costs
- Reduced carbon footprint and energy usage
- Enhanced compliance and brand value

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)

- Requires ongoing monitoring and optimization (Mitigation: automate with cloud-native tools and regular reviews)
- Potential need for architectural adjustments (Mitigation: phased adoption and pilot projects)

### Neutral Consequences

- May influence cloud provider and region selection

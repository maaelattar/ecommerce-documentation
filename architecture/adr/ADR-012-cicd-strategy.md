# ADR-012: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11 (User to confirm/update actual decision date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** (Lead Developers, DevOps/SRE Team if distinct)
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

The e-commerce platform, built on a microservices architecture (ADR-001) and intended for cloud-native deployment (ADR-006), requires a robust and automated approach to build, test, and deploy services. Manual processes are error-prone, slow, and do not scale with the number of services or the desired frequency of releases. A comprehensive CI/CD strategy is essential to enable rapid innovation, ensure software quality, and maintain a reliable deployment cadence.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Speed to Market:** Accelerate the delivery of new features and bug fixes.
*   **Quality & Reliability:** Improve code quality and deployment stability through automation and consistent processes.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Free up developers from manual build and deployment tasks.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure all services are built, tested, and deployed using a standardized process.
*   **Risk Reduction:** Minimize human error in deployment and enable quick rollbacks.
*   **Frequent Releases:** Support smaller, more frequent releases, reducing the risk associated with large, infrequent deployments.
*   **Scalability:** The CI/CD process must scale with the growing number of microservices and development teams.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Manual Build and Deployment

*   **Description:** Developers manually build artifacts, run tests locally, and deploy services by hand or using basic scripts.
*   **Pros:** Minimal initial setup.
*   **Cons:** Extremely slow, error-prone, inconsistent, not scalable, high operational overhead, poor reliability. Unsuitable for a modern microservices platform.

### Option 2: Siloed CI/CD (Per Service/Team)

*   **Description:** Each team or service implements its own CI/CD scripts or uses disparate tools.
*   **Pros:** Teams might have initial autonomy.
*   **Cons:** Lack of standardization, duplication of effort, inconsistent quality gates, difficult to manage centrally, potential for "CI/CD sprawl," difficult to enforce best practices or security policies across the board.

### Option 3: Centralized, Automated CI/CD Platform

*   **Description:** Implement a unified CI/CD platform and process for all microservices. This involves:
    *   **Version Control System (VCS):** Centralized Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
    *   **CI Server:** A dedicated server/service for build and test automation (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Tekton).
    *   **Automated Pipelines:** Defined pipelines for build, test, security scanning, artifact creation, and deployment.
    *   **Artifact Repository:** For storing build artifacts (e.g., Docker images).
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** For provisioning and managing environments.
    *   **Deployment Automation:** Tools to automate deployment to various environments (e.g., Kubernetes using Helm/Kustomize).
*   **Pros:** Standardization, consistency, high degree of automation, improved speed and reliability, better governance and security, scalable.
*   **Cons:** Higher initial setup and configuration effort, potential cost for tools/platform, learning curve for teams.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Centralized, Automated CI/CD Platform

**Reasoning:**
A centralized and automated CI/CD platform is fundamental for achieving the agility, quality, and reliability required for the e-commerce platform. It enables rapid iteration, consistent deployments, and frees developers to focus on building features. This aligns with the microservices (ADR-001) and cloud-native deployment (ADR-006) strategies.

**Key Implementation Details:**

1.  **Version Control:** Git (e.g., GitHub) will be the single source of truth for all code and pipeline definitions.
    *   **Branching Strategy:** A standardized branching strategy (e.g., GitHub Flow or GitFlow-lite) will be adopted to manage feature development, releases, and hotfixes.
2.  **CI/CD Platform (Initial Recommendation):**
    *   **GitHub Actions:** Given its tight integration with GitHub, ease of use for many common workflows, and good support for container-based builds and deployments to Kubernetes.
    *   **Alternatives considered:** Jenkins (powerful but can be complex to manage), GitLab CI (good if already using GitLab for VCS), Tekton (Kubernetes-native, flexible but can have a steeper learning curve). GitHub Actions offers a good balance for most teams.
3.  **Pipeline as Code:** All CI/CD pipelines MUST be defined as code (e.g., GitHub Actions YAML workflow files) and versioned alongside the service code.
4.  **Continuous Integration (CI) Stage:**
    *   **Trigger:** On every push to main branches and pull requests.
    *   **Steps:** Code checkout, dependency installation, linting, static code analysis (SAST), unit tests, contract tests, build Docker image, push image to artifact repository (e.g., GitHub Packages, Docker Hub, or cloud provider's container registry).
    *   **Security Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning for code dependencies and Docker images.
5.  **Artifact Repository:** A dedicated repository for Docker images.
6.  **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) Stage:**
    *   **Environments:** Define clear progression through environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production).
    *   **Triggers:** Automated deployment to Dev/Staging environments upon successful CI. Controlled (e.g., manual approval, scheduled) deployment to Production.
    *   **Deployment Strategy (ADR-006):** Leverage Kubernetes capabilities for rolling updates, blue/green, or canary deployments (using tools like Helm, Kustomize, or specialized CD tools like ArgoCD/Flux if adopting GitOps later).
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use Helm charts for packaging Kubernetes applications and Terraform for managing underlying cloud infrastructure.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Securely manage environment-specific configurations.
    *   **Automated Smoke Tests/Post-Deployment Verification:** Run basic tests after deployment to ensure service health.
    *   **Rollback:** Automated rollback mechanisms in case of deployment failures.
7.  **Security in CI/CD (DevSecOps):**
    *   Integrate security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, image scanning) into pipelines.
    *   Manage secrets securely (e.g., GitHub Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider's secret manager).

### Positive Consequences
*   Faster and more frequent releases.
*   Improved software quality and stability.
*   Increased developer productivity and satisfaction.
*   Reduced manual errors and deployment risks.
*   Standardized and auditable build and release processes.
*   Easier rollbacks.

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   **Initial Setup Complexity & Time:** Setting up robust pipelines for all services takes time.
    *   **Mitigation:** Develop reusable pipeline templates and shared actions/workflows. Start with a core set of services and iterate. Provide training and documentation.
*   **Tooling Costs:** Potential costs associated with the CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions minutes/storage for private repos, artifact repository costs).
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize pipeline efficiency. Choose appropriate pricing tiers. Evaluate open-source alternatives for specific components if cost becomes a major constraint, but weigh against operational overhead.
*   **Learning Curve:** Teams need to learn the chosen CI/CD tools and practices.
    *   **Mitigation:** Provide training, documentation, and examples. Foster a DevOps culture.
*   **Pipeline Maintenance:** Pipelines themselves require maintenance and updates.
    *   **Mitigation:** Treat pipeline code like application code (versioning, testing where possible). Regularly review and refactor pipelines.
*   **Potential Bottlenecks:** Poorly designed pipelines or limited runner capacity can become bottlenecks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize pipeline steps. Scale runners appropriately. Parallelize tasks where possible.

*   **Progressive Delivery:** More advanced canary release strategies with automated analysis and promotion/rollback.
*   **ChatOps:** Integrating CI/CD notifications and actions with chat platforms.
*   **Value Stream Mapping:** Analyzing and optimizing the entire development to deployment lifecycle.

## Rejection Criteria

*   If the chosen platform proves too restrictive or expensive for the team's needs and skills, and a simpler or more cost-effective solution can achieve the core CI/CD goals initially.

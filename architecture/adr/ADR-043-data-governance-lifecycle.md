# ADR: Data Governance & Lifecycle

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-12
*   **Deciders:** [Architecture Team, Data Protection Officer]
*   **Consulted:** [Legal, DevOps, Product Owners]
*   **Informed:** [All Engineering Teams]

## Context and Problem Statement

Ecommerce platforms handle sensitive data (PII, payment info) and must comply with regulations (GDPR, PCI DSS). Without clear data governance, there is risk of non-compliance, data breaches, and unclear data ownership. A structured approach is needed for data lifecycle management, access, and compliance.

## Decision Drivers
*   Regulatory compliance (GDPR, PCI DSS)
*   Data security and privacy
*   Data quality and stewardship
*   Auditability and transparency

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Formal Data Governance Program
*   Description: Define data retention, archival, anonymization, and deletion policies. Document data ownership, access controls, and audit processes. Use automation for lifecycle management.
*   Pros:
    *   Ensures compliance and auditability
    *   Reduces risk of data breaches
    *   Clear data management responsibilities
*   Cons:
    *   Requires process and tooling setup
    *   Ongoing policy enforcement effort

### Option 2: Ad-hoc Data Management
*   Description: Allow teams to manage data as needed, without formal policies or automation.
*   Pros:
    *   Minimal initial effort
    *   Flexibility for teams
*   Cons:
    *   High risk of non-compliance
    *   Unclear data ownership
    *   Harder to audit and enforce policies

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Formal Data Governance Program

**Reasoning:**
A formal program ensures compliance, security, and efficient data management. The benefits of reduced risk and clear responsibilities outweigh the setup and maintenance effort.

### Positive Consequences
*   Improved compliance and auditability
*   Reduced risk of data breaches
*   Clear data management responsibilities

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   Ongoing operational overhead (Mitigation: Automate policy enforcement and reviews)
*   Requires cultural change (Mitigation: Training and clear documentation)

### Neutral Consequences
*   May require updates to existing data stores and workflows

## Future Considerations (Optional)
*   Expand automation and monitoring for data lifecycle
*   Integrate data governance with CI/CD and incident response

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)
*   If governance overhead exceeds benefits, reconsider or simplify approach

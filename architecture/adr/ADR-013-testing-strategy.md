# ADR-013: Testing Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11 (User to confirm/update actual decision date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** (Lead Developers, QA Lead/Team if distinct)
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

A robust testing strategy is critical for ensuring the quality, reliability, and correctness of the e-commerce platform, especially within a microservices architecture (ADR-001). Without a comprehensive approach to testing at various levels, bugs can slip into production, leading to poor user experience, financial loss, and damage to reputation. Different types of tests are needed to cover various aspects, from individual code units to end-to-end user flows and non-functional requirements. This strategy must integrate seamlessly with the CI/CD pipeline (ADR-012).

## Decision Drivers

*   **Quality Assurance:** Ensure that services and the overall system meet functional and non-functional requirements.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Reduce the likelihood of defects reaching production.
*   **Early Bug Detection:** Find and fix issues as early as possible in the development lifecycle, reducing the cost of fixing them.
*   **Confidence in Releases:** Enable frequent and reliable deployments (as per ADR-012).
*   **Regression Prevention:** Ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
*   **Documentation:** Tests serve as a form of executable documentation for service behavior.
*   **Maintainability:** Well-tested code is generally easier to understand, refactor, and maintain.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Manual Testing Only

*   **Description:** Rely primarily on manual testing by QA engineers or developers before releases.
*   **Pros:** Low initial setup for automation. Can catch usability issues not easily automated.
*   **Cons:** Extremely slow, error-prone, not scalable, high cost for repetitive tests, poor coverage for complex systems, does not fit a CI/CD model. Unsuitable as the primary strategy.

### Option 2: Focus on End-to-End (E2E) UI Tests

*   **Description:** Prioritize automated E2E tests that simulate user interactions through the UI.
*   **Pros:** Tests the system from the user's perspective. Can catch integration issues across multiple services.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Slow to execute.
    *   Brittle and hard to maintain, especially with UI changes.
    *   Difficult to pinpoint the exact source of failure.
    *   Does not effectively test individual service logic or non-UI APIs.
    *   The "ice-cream cone" anti-pattern if it's the *only* significant automated testing.

### Option 3: Comprehensive, Multi-Layered Automated Testing (Test Pyramid)

*   **Description:** Implement a balanced portfolio of automated tests at different levels, following the principles of the test pyramid:
    *   **Unit Tests (Foundation):** Test individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation. Fast, numerous, and focused.
    *   **Service/Integration Tests (Middle Layer):** Test interactions between components within a single service or between a service and its direct dependencies (e.g., database, message broker). This includes API contract tests.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Top Layer):** Test complete user flows across multiple services and UI. Fewer, slower, and broader in scope.
    *   **Non-Functional Tests:** Performance, load, security, and usability testing.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Provides comprehensive coverage.
    *   Faster feedback loops (unit and service tests run quickly).
    *   More reliable and easier to maintain than E2E-heavy strategies.
    *   Better isolation of failures.
    *   Aligns well with CI/CD.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires discipline and effort to write and maintain tests at all levels.
    *   Setting up realistic test environments for service/integration tests can be challenging.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Comprehensive, Multi-Layered Automated Testing (Test Pyramid)

**Reasoning:**
A multi-layered testing strategy, guided by the test pyramid, provides the best balance of coverage, speed, reliability, and maintainability for a microservices-based e-commerce platform. This approach ensures quality at all levels and supports the rapid, reliable delivery goals of the CI/CD strategy (ADR-012).

**Key Implementation Details:**

1.  **Unit Tests:**
    *   **Scope:** Test individual modules, classes, and functions in isolation.
    *   **Tools:** Frameworks appropriate to the service's language (e.g., Jest for Node.js/NestJS).
    *   **Responsibility:** Developers.
    *   **Execution:** Run on every commit/PR in the CI pipeline. High code coverage targets will be set (e.g., >80%).
2.  **Service/Integration Tests:**
    *   **Scope:**
        *   **Intra-Service:** Test interactions between components *within* a single microservice (e.g., service layer to repository layer).
        *   **Contract Tests (Inter-Service):** Verify that a service adheres to the API contracts it provides (consumer-driven contracts using tools like Pact, or provider-driven tests against OpenAPI specs). This is critical for API-First design (ADR-007).
        *   **External Dependencies:** Test interactions with direct external dependencies like databases (ADR-004) or message brokers (ADR-002), often using test containers or in-memory versions.
    *   **Tools:** Testing frameworks, HTTP client libraries, Pact, Testcontainers.
    *   **Responsibility:** Developers.
    *   **Execution:** Run on every commit/PR in the CI pipeline after unit tests pass.
3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    *   **Scope:** Test critical user flows through the UI and across multiple services (e.g., user registration, product search, add to cart, checkout).
    *   **Tools:** UI automation frameworks (e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium). API-level E2E tests for core business flows without UI interaction.
    *   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers, with support from Developers.
    *   **Execution:** Run less frequently than unit/service tests (e.g., nightly, before deployment to staging/production) due to their longer execution time. Run against deployed environments.
4.  **Non-Functional Testing (NFT):**
    *   **Performance & Load Tests:** Simulate expected and peak loads to identify bottlenecks and ensure services meet performance NFRs (e.g., using k6, JMeter).
    *   **Security Tests:**
        *   SAST/DAST and dependency scanning integrated into CI pipeline (ADR-012).
        *   Penetration testing conducted periodically.
    *   **Usability Testing:** Manual and potentially some automated checks for accessibility and user experience.
    *   **Resilience/Chaos Tests (Future):** Proactively inject failures to test system resilience (e.g., Chaos Mesh, LitmusChaos).
    *   **Responsibility:** Specialized QA/SRE, Developers.
    *   **Execution:** Periodically, before major releases, or as part of dedicated performance testing cycles. Some security scans in CI.
5.  **Test Data Management:**
    *   Develop strategies for creating and managing consistent and realistic test data for all test levels.
    *   Isolate test data to prevent interference between tests.
6.  **Test Environments:**
    *   Provide stable and isolated environments for different testing stages (e.g., local development, CI, staging).
    *   Leverage containerization and IaC for environment provisioning.
7.  **Integration with CI/CD (ADR-012):**
    *   Unit and service/integration tests are mandatory gates in the CI pipeline.
    *   E2E tests run against staging before production promotion.
    *   Test reports and coverage metrics are published and monitored.

### Positive Consequences
*   Higher software quality and fewer production defects.
*   Increased confidence in releases.
*   Faster feedback loops for developers.
*   Improved ability to refactor and evolve services.
*   Clear, executable documentation of service behavior.

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   **Time Investment:** Writing and maintaining a comprehensive suite of tests requires significant developer and QA effort.
    *   **Mitigation:** Foster a strong testing culture. Provide training and resources. Prioritize testing for critical paths and complex logic. Use code generation or scaffolding for boilerplate test code where possible.
*   **Slow Test Execution (especially E2E):** Can slow down CI/CD pipelines if not managed.
    *   **Mitigation:** Follow the test pyramid (more fast unit/service tests, fewer slow E2E). Run E2E tests in parallel. Optimize E2E test design for speed and reliability. Run E2E tests less frequently or selectively.
*   **Test Environment Complexity:** Setting up and maintaining environments for integration and E2E tests can be complex.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use Docker, Testcontainers, and IaC to automate environment provisioning. Leverage service virtualization or mocking for dependencies where appropriate.
*   **Flaky Tests:** Poorly written or unstable tests can erode confidence and waste time.
    *   **Mitigation:** Establish clear guidelines for writing reliable tests. Regularly review and refactor tests. Quarantine or fix flaky tests promptly.

# ADR: Cost Optimization & FinOps

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-12
*   **Deciders:** [Architecture Team, Finance]
*   **Consulted:** [DevOps, Product Owners]
*   **Informed:** [All Engineering Teams]

## Context and Problem Statement

Cloud costs can grow rapidly with scale. Without proactive cost management, the platform risks overspending, budget overruns, and inefficient resource usage. A structured approach to cost optimization and FinOps is needed.

## Decision Drivers
*   Cost visibility and accountability
*   Sustainable growth and resource efficiency
*   Budget compliance and forecasting
*   Enabling business agility

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Implement FinOps Practices and Tooling
*   Description: Tag resources, use cloud-native cost monitoring, set budgets/alerts, and regularly review resource usage.
*   Pros:
    *   Improved cost visibility
    *   Enables chargeback/showback
    *   Supports proactive optimization
*   Cons:
    *   Requires process and tooling setup
    *   Ongoing effort for reviews

### Option 2: Ad-hoc Cost Management
*   Description: Monitor and optimize costs only when issues arise.
*   Pros:
    *   Minimal initial effort
    *   No new processes required
*   Cons:
    *   High risk of overspending
    *   Lack of accountability
    *   Harder to forecast and control costs

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Implement FinOps Practices and Tooling

**Reasoning:**
A proactive, structured approach to cost management ensures sustainable growth, prevents budget overruns, and enables teams to make informed trade-offs. The benefits of visibility and control outweigh the setup and maintenance effort.

### Positive Consequences
*   Improved cost visibility and accountability
*   Reduced waste and unnecessary spend
*   Better forecasting and planning

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   Ongoing process overhead (Mitigation: Automate reporting and reviews)
*   Requires cultural change (Mitigation: Provide training and incentives)

### Neutral Consequences
*   May require changes to resource provisioning workflows

## Future Considerations (Optional)
*   Integrate cost data with business KPIs
*   Expand automation for cost optimization

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)
*   If FinOps overhead exceeds benefits, reconsider or simplify approach

# ADR: API Documentation Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-12
*   **Deciders:** [Architecture Team]
*   **Consulted:** [API Consumers, DevOps]
*   **Informed:** [All Developers]

## Context and Problem Statement

The platform exposes multiple APIs for internal and external consumers. Inconsistent or outdated documentation leads to integration errors, increased support burden, and slow onboarding. A standardized, automated approach to API documentation is needed.

## Decision Drivers
*   Developer experience and onboarding
*   API discoverability and usability
*   Reducing integration errors
*   Supporting API-first development

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Automated OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation
*   Description: Use OpenAPI (Swagger) for REST APIs, generate and publish docs automatically via CI/CD, and provide interactive docs (Swagger UI, Redoc).
*   Pros:
    *   Consistent, up-to-date documentation
    *   Easy to integrate with developer tools
    *   Supports code generation and testing
*   Cons:
    *   Requires initial setup and maintenance
    *   May need training for teams unfamiliar with OpenAPI

### Option 2: Manual Documentation (Markdown, Wiki)
*   Description: Write and maintain API docs manually in Markdown or a wiki.
*   Pros:
    *   Simple to start
    *   No tooling required
*   Cons:
    *   Prone to becoming outdated
    *   Lacks interactivity and automation
    *   Harder to enforce standards

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Automated OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation

**Reasoning:**
Automated documentation ensures accuracy, reduces manual effort, and improves developer experience. It supports API-first development and enables faster, safer integrations. The benefits outweigh the initial setup cost.

### Positive Consequences
*   Improved developer experience and onboarding
*   Fewer integration errors
*   Easier API lifecycle management

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   Initial setup effort (Mitigation: Provide templates and training)
*   Tooling maintenance (Mitigation: Integrate into CI/CD and review regularly)

### Neutral Consequences
*   May require updates to existing APIs to conform to standards

## Future Considerations (Optional)
*   Expand to GraphQL and gRPC documentation as needed
*   Integrate with API gateways for live documentation

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)
*   If automated docs become a bottleneck or are not maintained, reconsider approach

# ADR-025: Data Backup and Recovery Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** DevOps/SRE Team, Lead Developers, Database Administrators (if any)
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

Following our "Database per Service" strategy (ADR-020), each microservice manages its own data. It's crucial to have a comprehensive data backup and recovery strategy to protect against data loss due to hardware failures, software bugs, human error, or cyber-attacks. This ADR defines the principles and approaches for backing up and restoring data for all service databases.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Data Durability & Availability:** Ensure data can be recovered in case of loss, minimizing downtime.
*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Define the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours).
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Define the maximum acceptable time to restore data and service functionality after an incident.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure backups are consistent and usable for restoration (e.g., point-in-time recovery for databases).
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Balance backup frequency and retention with storage costs.
*   **Security:** Secure backups against unauthorized access or tampering.
*   **Automation:** Automate backup and recovery processes as much as possible.
*   **Testability:** Regularly test the recovery process to ensure its effectiveness.

## Considered Options

This ADR focuses on establishing a framework and requirements rather than specific vendor tools for every database, as we have polyglot persistence (ADR-020).

1.  **Database-Native Backup Tools:** Utilize built-in backup capabilities of specific databases (e.g., `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL, `mongodump` for MongoDB, snapshots for managed cloud databases).
2.  **Volume-Level Snapshots (Kubernetes/Cloud Provider):** Use snapshot capabilities of the underlying storage volumes where databases are deployed on Kubernetes (ADR-006).
3.  **Third-Party Backup Solutions:** Employ specialized backup software that supports various databases and integrates with Kubernetes (e.g., Velero, Kasten K10).

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Approach:** A layered strategy primarily leveraging **database-native backup tools** and **volume-level snapshots**, managed and automated within our Kubernetes environment. Third-party solutions may be considered for specific, complex needs.

*   **Service-Specific RPO/RTO:**
    *   Each service team, in consultation with product owners, MUST define and document the RPO and RTO for their service's data. This will dictate backup frequency and retention policies.
    *   Critical services (e.g., Orders, Payments, Users) will typically have lower RPO/RTO values than less critical ones (e.g., non-transactional analytics data).

*   **Backup Mechanisms:**
    *   **Primary Method:** Database-native tools for logical backups (e.g., point-in-time recovery capabilities, full/incremental dumps). This provides fine-grained control and often ensures application-level consistency.
    *   **Secondary/Complementary Method:** Volume-level snapshots for faster, block-level backups, especially for quick rollback scenarios or disaster recovery of the entire database instance. Consistency must be ensured (e.g., quiescing the database or using crash-consistent snapshots if appropriate for the DB technology).
    *   For managed cloud databases, leverage the provider's automated backup and point-in-time recovery (PITR) features.

*   **Backup Storage and Security:**
    *   Backups MUST be stored in a separate, secure location from the primary database environment (e.g., different availability zone, different region, or a dedicated backup storage service like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
    *   Backups MUST be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    *   Access to backup files and restoration capabilities MUST be strictly controlled via IAM/RBAC.

*   **Automation:**
    *   Backup schedules and processes MUST be automated (e.g., using Kubernetes CronJobs, database operator features, or CI/CD pipeline tasks - ADR-012).
    *   Automated alerts (ADR-021) for backup failures or anomalies.

*   **Retention Policy:**
    *   Backup retention periods will be defined based on RPO, RTO, business requirements, and compliance/legal obligations for each service.
    *   Typically, a combination of daily, weekly, and monthly backups with varying retention will be implemented (e.g., 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly).

*   **Recovery Testing:**
    *   Regular, automated testing of the data recovery process is MANDATORY. This includes restoring backups to a non-production environment and verifying data integrity and application functionality.
    *   Recovery drills should be conducted periodically (e.g., quarterly) for critical services.

*   **Documentation:**
    *   Each service MUST document its specific backup and recovery procedures, including RPO/RTO, backup schedule, retention policy, and steps for restoration.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   Provides a robust framework for protecting service data.
    *   Allows flexibility for different database technologies used by services.
    *   Emphasis on automation and testing improves reliability.
    *   Clear RPO/RTO definitions align backup strategy with business needs.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires each service team to take responsibility for their data backup and recovery implementation (though with central guidelines).
    *   Managing backups for a diverse set of databases can be complex.
    *   Recovery testing can be time-consuming if not fully automated.
    *   Storage costs for backups can be significant.
*   **Risks:**
    *   Inconsistent implementation across services if guidelines are not followed.
    *   Recovery tests might not cover all failure scenarios.
    *   Failure to meet RPO/RTO if backups are not frequent enough or restoration takes too long.

## Next Steps

*   Develop detailed guidelines and templates for service teams to define their RPO/RTO and document their backup/recovery procedures.
*   Evaluate and recommend standard tools or Kubernetes operators for automating backups for common database types (e.g., PostgreSQL operator with backup features).
*   Set up secure, centralized backup storage locations (e.g., S3 buckets with appropriate policies).
*   Implement automated monitoring and alerting for backup jobs.
*   Schedule initial recovery drills for critical services once backups are configured.

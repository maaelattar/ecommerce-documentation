# ADR-011: Monitoring and Alerting Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11 (User to confirm/update actual decision date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** (Lead Developers, SRE/Ops Team if distinct)
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

A microservices architecture (ADR-001) introduces distributed components that need to be actively monitored to ensure system health, performance, and availability. Without a comprehensive monitoring and alerting strategy, it's difficult to proactively identify issues, understand resource utilization, diagnose performance degradation, and respond quickly to incidents. Relying solely on reactive troubleshooting based on user complaints or system failures is not acceptable for a production e-commerce platform.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Proactive Issue Detection:** Identify and address problems before they impact users.
*   **System Health Visibility:** Provide a clear view of the operational status of all services and infrastructure.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Track key metrics to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
*   **Resource Management:** Monitor resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk, network) to ensure efficient use and plan capacity.
*   **Availability & Reliability:** Ensure services meet their SLOs/SLAs by quickly detecting and responding to outages or degradation.
*   **Incident Response:** Provide actionable alerts to the appropriate teams to facilitate rapid response and resolution.
*   **Business Impact Awareness:** Correlate technical metrics with business KPIs where possible.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Basic Infrastructure Monitoring Only

*   **Description:** Rely on basic metrics provided by the cloud provider or Kubernetes (e.g., CPU, memory utilization of nodes/pods). No application-specific metrics or deep insights. Alerting is minimal, often based on high-level infrastructure failures.
*   **Pros:** Simple to set up; often available out-of-the-box with cloud platforms.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Lacks application-level visibility (e.g., request latency, error rates per service).
    *   Insufficient for diagnosing complex issues within services.
    *   Alerting is often too generic or too late.
    *   Difficult to understand the end-to-end user experience.

### Option 2: Siloed Monitoring (Per Service/Team)

*   **Description:** Each service or team implements its own monitoring tools and dashboards without a unified approach.
*   **Pros:** Teams have autonomy to choose tools they are familiar with.
*   **Cons:**
    *   No unified view of system health.
    *   Inconsistent metrics and alerting thresholds.
    *   Difficult to correlate issues across services.
    *   Inefficient use of resources (multiple monitoring stacks).
    *   Can lead to "alert fatigue" if not managed centrally.

### Option 3: Centralized Monitoring and Alerting Platform

*   **Description:** Implement a centralized platform for collecting, storing, visualizing, and alerting on metrics from all services and infrastructure components.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   **Metrics Collection:** Services expose metrics in a standard format (e.g., Prometheus exposition format). Agents collect metrics from infrastructure and applications.
        *   **Metrics Storage:** A time-series database (TSDB) like Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, M3DB, or a cloud provider solution (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring, Azure Monitor).
        *   **Visualization:** Dashboards (e.g., Grafana, Kibana, cloud provider consoles) to display metrics and trends.
        *   **Alerting:** An alerting engine (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana Alerting) to define alert rules and notify teams.
        *   **Distributed Tracing:** (Often complementary) Tools like Jaeger or Zipkin to trace requests across service boundaries.
        *   **Log Integration:** (ADR-010) Logs provide context to metrics and alerts.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Unified view of system health and performance.
    *   Standardized metrics and alerting.
    *   Enables correlation of issues across services.
    *   Proactive alerting on key performance indicators (KPIs) and service level objectives (SLOs).
    *   Facilitates root cause analysis.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires investment in setting up and maintaining the platform (if self-hosted).
    *   Services need to be instrumented to expose relevant metrics.
    *   Defining meaningful alerts and dashboards requires effort.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Centralized Monitoring and Alerting Platform

**Reasoning:**
A centralized monitoring and alerting platform is crucial for maintaining the health, performance, and reliability of a distributed microservices system. It provides the necessary visibility and proactive capabilities to operate the e-commerce platform effectively.

**Key Implementation Details:**

1.  **Core Monitoring Stack (Initial Recommendation):**
    *   **Metrics Collection & Storage:** **Prometheus** (industry standard, wide adoption, pull-based model suitable for Kubernetes).
    *   **Visualization:** **Grafana** (powerful, flexible dashboards, integrates well with Prometheus and other data sources).
    *   **Alerting:** **Prometheus Alertmanager** (handles deduplication, grouping, and routing of alerts).
    *   This is often referred to as the "PGA Stack" (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager).
2.  **Application Metrics (Service Instrumentation):**
    *   Services MUST be instrumented to expose key application-level metrics in Prometheus format.
    *   Focus on the "Four Golden Signals": **Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation**.
    *   For NestJS services, libraries like `nestjs-prometheus` can be used.
3.  **Infrastructure Metrics:**
    *   Kubernetes cluster metrics (nodes, pods, deployments, etc.) will be collected using `kube-state-metrics` and node exporters.
    *   Cloud provider infrastructure metrics will also be integrated.
4.  **Standard Dashboards:** Develop standard Grafana dashboards for:
    *   Overall system health.
    *   Per-service performance (golden signals).
    *   Kubernetes cluster status.
    *   Key infrastructure components (e.g., databases, message brokers from ADR-002).
5.  **Alerting Strategy:**
    *   Define clear Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for key services.
    *   Alerts will be based on violations of SLOs and critical error conditions.
    *   Prioritize actionable alerts to avoid alert fatigue.
    *   Alerts routed to appropriate teams via defined notification channels (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty, email).
6.  **Log Integration (ADR-010):** Monitoring dashboards should allow easy correlation with logs (e.g., linking from a Grafana panel to Kibana with relevant filters).
7.  **Distributed Tracing (Future Consideration, but important):** While not part of the *core* monitoring stack initially, integrating a distributed tracing system (e.g., Jaeger, OpenTelemetry) is highly recommended and will be a subsequent step. Traces provide deep insight into request flows and latencies across services. Log entries and metrics should include Trace IDs.

### Positive Consequences
*   Proactive identification of issues and performance bottlenecks.
*   Improved system reliability and availability.
*   Faster incident response and resolution.
*   Better capacity planning and resource optimization.
*   Data-driven decision-making for system improvements.

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   **Complexity of Setup and Maintenance:** If self-hosting Prometheus/Grafana.
    *   **Mitigation:** Leverage managed cloud offerings for Prometheus/Grafana (e.g., AWS Managed Service for Prometheus, Azure Monitor for Prometheus, Grafana Cloud) to reduce operational overhead. Use Helm charts for deployment.
*   **Cost:** Storage for metrics data, resources for the monitoring stack, potential costs for managed services.
    *   **Mitigation:** Define appropriate metric retention policies. Optimize metric cardinality.
*   **Instrumentation Effort:** Services need to be instrumented.
    *   **Mitigation:** Provide standardized libraries, client SDKs, and clear guidelines for instrumentation. Start with essential metrics.
*   **Alert Fatigue:** Poorly configured alerts can overwhelm teams.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on actionable alerts. Continuously refine alert thresholds. Implement alert silencing for known issues or maintenance.

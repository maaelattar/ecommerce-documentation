# ADR: Adoption of Microservices Architecture for E-commerce Platform

*   **Status:** Accepted
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11 (User to confirm/update actual decision date)
*   **Deciders:** Project Team (Initial decision based on collaborative discussion and alignment with architectural vision)
*   **Consulted:** (N/A for this foundational, implicit decision - can be updated if specific consultations occurred)
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

The e-commerce platform aims to be highly scalable, resilient, and agile, supporting rapid innovation and global market expansion. Traditional monolithic architectures often struggle to meet these demands for complex, evolving systems due to tight coupling, difficulties in independent scaling, and challenges in adopting diverse technologies. Key goals include achieving speed to market, independent scalability of components, robust fault isolation, and enabling technology diversity.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Scalability & Elasticity:** Need to handle varying loads for different parts of the platform independently (NFR).
*   **Agility & Speed to Market:** Enable faster, independent development and deployment cycles for different features/domains (Business & Technical Driver).
*   **Resilience & Fault Isolation:** Ensure that a failure in one part of the system does not cascade and bring down the entire platform (NFR & Technical Driver).
*   **Maintainability & Evolvability:** Create smaller, focused codebases that are easier to understand, maintain, and evolve (NFR).
*   **Technology Diversity:** Allow teams to choose the most appropriate technology stack for their specific service's needs (Technical Driver).
*   **Developer Productivity & Team Autonomy:** Empower smaller, focused teams to own and iterate on their services independently (Technical Driver).

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Monolithic Architecture

*   **Description:** A single, large, unified application codebase and deployment unit containing all e-commerce functionalities.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Simpler initial development setup.
    *   Easier local testing of the entire application.
    *   Single deployment unit can simplify initial deployment processes.
    *   Cross-cutting concerns can be easier to implement initially.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Difficult to scale components independently; the entire application must be scaled.
    *   Tight coupling between components makes changes risky and development slower as the system grows.
    *   Technology stack is uniform, limiting flexibility.
    *   Large codebase becomes hard to understand and maintain over time.
    *   Longer build and deployment times as the application size increases.
    *   A single point of failure can impact the entire application.

### Option 2: Microservices Architecture

*   **Description:** Decomposing the application into a collection of small, autonomous, and independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business capability.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Services can be scaled independently based on their specific demands.
    *   Improved fault isolation; failure in one service is less likely to affect others.
    *   Enables technology diversity; services can be built with different languages and data stores.
    *   Smaller, more focused codebases are easier to understand, maintain, and test.
    *   Supports independent development and deployment by smaller, autonomous teams, leading to faster release cycles.
    *   Clearer ownership of services.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Increased operational complexity due to managing multiple services.
    *   Challenges inherent in distributed systems (e.g., network latency, inter-service communication, data consistency).
    *   More complex testing strategies are required (integration testing, contract testing).
    *   Requires mature DevOps practices and automation.
    *   Potential for service proliferation if not managed carefully.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Microservices Architecture

**Reasoning:**
The Microservices Architecture is chosen because it directly aligns with the core architectural vision and goals for the e-commerce platform, particularly regarding scalability, agility, resilience, and technology flexibility. It supports the business and technical drivers by enabling independent development, deployment, and scaling of services, which is crucial for rapid innovation and adapting to market demands.

While acknowledging the increased operational complexity, the benefits of a microservices approach for a platform of this intended scale and complexity are deemed to outweigh these challenges. These complexities will be mitigated through:
*   Adoption of cloud-native technologies and managed services.
*   Robust CI/CD automation.
*   Comprehensive observability (logging, monitoring, tracing).
*   Strong API contracts and an API-first approach.
*   Complementary use of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) patterns.

This decision is foundational and is reflected in the `00-system-architecture-overview.md` document.

### Positive Consequences
*   Enhanced ability to scale individual services based on specific load.
*   Improved fault isolation, leading to higher overall system resilience.
*   Flexibility to choose the best technology stack for each service.
*   Faster, independent release cycles for individual services.
*   Smaller, more manageable codebases, improving developer productivity and maintainability.
*   Clearer team ownership and accountability for services.

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)
*   **Increased Operational Complexity:** Managing a larger number of deployed services, their configurations, and interactions.
    *   **Mitigation:** Utilize container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), implement robust CI/CD pipelines, leverage managed cloud services, and establish strong observability practices.
*   **Distributed System Challenges:** Dealing with network latency, ensuring data consistency across services, and debugging issues across multiple services.
    *   **Mitigation:** Employ asynchronous communication patterns (Event-Driven Architecture), use distributed tracing, design for eventual consistency where appropriate (e.g., Sagas), and implement robust inter-service communication strategies (e.g., API Gateway, potentially a service mesh later).
*   **More Complex Testing Strategies:** Ensuring services integrate correctly and end-to-end flows work as expected.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive unit tests, thorough contract testing between services, targeted integration tests, and end-to-end tests for critical user journeys.
*   **Potential for Increased Infrastructure Costs:** Due to the overhead of multiple service instances and supporting infrastructure.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize resource utilization through efficient scaling strategies and right-sizing of services; leverage serverless components where appropriate.

### Neutral Consequences
*   Requires a shift in development team mindset towards distributed systems thinking.

## Future Considerations

*   The granularity of microservices may evolve as the system matures and understanding of domain boundaries deepens.
*   Adoption of a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) might be considered in the future if inter-service communication complexity grows significantly and requires advanced traffic management, security, or observability features at the mesh level.
*   Continuous evaluation of inter-service communication patterns and data consistency strategies.

## Rejection Criteria

*   If the platform's scale remains significantly smaller than anticipated for an extended period, making the overhead of microservices unjustifiable.
*   If the team is unable to achieve the necessary DevOps maturity and automation, leading to unmanageable operational burdens.

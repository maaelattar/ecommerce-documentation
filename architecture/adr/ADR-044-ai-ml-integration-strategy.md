# ADR-044: AI/ML Integration Strategy

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-05-12
- **Deciders:** CTO, Data Science Lead, Platform Engineering Lead
- **Consulted:** Product Management, Security Lead, DevOps Team
- **Informed:** All Engineering Teams, Business Stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

AI/ML capabilities such as recommendations, personalization, and fraud detection are critical for modern e-commerce platforms. Integrating AI/ML into a cloud native architecture requires robust strategies for model deployment, monitoring, scaling, and governance to ensure reliability, security, and business value.

## Decision Drivers

- Business value from AI/ML-driven features (e.g., recommendations, fraud detection)
- Scalability and reliability of model serving
- Security and compliance of data and models
- Operational efficiency and automation

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Cloud Native AI/ML Platform Integration

- Description: Use cloud native tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Kubeflow, MLflow, Seldon Core) for model deployment, monitoring, and scaling. Integrate with CI/CD and observability stacks.
- Pros:
  - Scalable, automated, and consistent model operations
  - Easy integration with existing platform tooling
  - Supports multi-cloud and hybrid deployments
- Cons:
  - Requires investment in platform setup and expertise
  - Ongoing maintenance of ML infrastructure

### Option 2: Managed AI/ML Services (Cloud Provider)

- Description: Use managed services (e.g., AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure ML) for end-to-end ML lifecycle.
- Pros:
  - Simplifies operations and reduces infrastructure overhead
  - Built-in security and compliance features
- Cons:
  - Potential vendor lock-in
  - Limited customization and portability

### Option 3: Ad-hoc Model Deployment (Per Team)

- Description: Each team manages its own model deployment and serving approach.
- Pros:
  - Maximum flexibility
- Cons:
  - Inconsistent practices and tooling
  - Harder to govern, scale, and secure

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 1: Cloud Native AI/ML Platform Integration

**Reasoning:**
A cloud native approach provides the best balance of scalability, flexibility, and integration with the existing platform. It enables consistent, automated, and secure model operations, supporting both current and future AI/ML use cases.

### Positive Consequences

- Scalable and reliable AI/ML model serving
- Consistent monitoring, governance, and security
- Supports rapid experimentation and deployment

### Negative Consequences (and Mitigations)

- Requires initial investment in platform setup (Mitigation: phased rollout, leverage open source tools)
- Ongoing maintenance (Mitigation: automate with CI/CD and monitoring)

### Neutral Consequences

- May influence technology and skillset requirements

## Future Considerations (Optional)

- Expand to support real-time and batch inference
- Integrate with feature stores and data pipelines
- Monitor for model drift and automate retraining

## Rejection Criteria (Optional)

- If platform complexity outweighs benefits for current use cases, consider managed services or hybrid approach

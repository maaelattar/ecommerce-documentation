# ADR-031: Code Quality, Static Analysis, and Review Standards

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11
*   **Deciders:** Project Team, Lead Developers, QA Team
*   **Consulted:** Development Teams
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

Maintaining a high level of code quality is essential for the long-term health, maintainability, and reliability of our e-commerce platform. While previous ADRs cover testing (ADR-013), developer environments (ADR-029), and security scanning (ADR-026 SAST/DAST), this ADR focuses on defining specific standards for code style, static analysis beyond security, code complexity, and mandatory code review processes to ensure all contributions meet a consistent quality bar.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Maintainability:** Code should be easy to read, understand, and modify by any developer on the team.
*   **Reliability:** Reduce bugs and unexpected behavior through consistent practices and early detection of issues.
*   **Collaboration:** Facilitate effective teamwork and knowledge sharing through readable code and structured reviews.
*   **Scalability of Development:** Ensure that as the team and codebase grow, quality does not degrade.
*   **Reduced Technical Debt:** Proactively manage and prevent the accumulation of technical debt.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Clear standards and automated checks can speed up development by reducing time spent on trivial issues during reviews.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Approach:** Implement a multi-pronged strategy involving standardized code styling, comprehensive static analysis integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (ADR-012), defined code complexity metrics, and a formal, mandatory code review process.

### 1. Code Styling and Formatting
*   **Standardized Formatters:** Adopt and enforce a consistent code formatter for our primary technology stack (Node.js/NestJS/TypeScript - ADR-003). **Prettier** is selected as the standard code formatter.
    *   Configuration for Prettier will be defined in the project root (e.g., `.prettierrc.js`, `.prettierignore`) and committed to version control.
*   **Linters for Style and Best Practices:** Use **ESLint** with a robust set of rules (e.g., extending `eslint:recommended`, `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`, and potentially NestJS specific plugins).
    *   ESLint configuration will be defined in the project root (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintignore`) and committed to version control.
*   **Automated Checks:** Integrate formatter and linter checks into pre-commit hooks (e.g., using Husky and lint-staged) and as mandatory steps in the CI pipeline (ADR-012). Builds should fail if formatting or linting errors are present.

### 2. Static Analysis (Beyond Basic Linting)
*   **Code Complexity:**
    *   Monitor cyclomatic complexity and cognitive complexity of functions/methods.
    *   Tools like SonarQube (if adopted), or ESLint plugins (e.g., `eslint-plugin-complexity`) can be used to track these metrics.
    *   Establish reasonable thresholds. High complexity functions should be flagged for refactoring.
*   **Duplication Detection:** Identify and minimize duplicated code blocks. Tools used for complexity analysis often also provide duplication detection.
*   **Code Smells and Anti-Patterns:** Configure static analysis tools to detect common code smells (e.g., long methods, large classes, inappropriate intimacy, feature envy) and anti-patterns specific to our framework (NestJS).
*   **Test Coverage:** While ADR-013 (Testing Strategy) outlines test types, we will enforce minimum test coverage targets (e.g., 80% line/branch coverage for new/modified code) measured by tools like Istanbul/nyc (for Node.js/TypeScript) and integrated into the CI pipeline. Pull requests not meeting coverage targets should be flagged.

### 3. Code Review Process
*   **Mandatory Reviews:** All code contributions (features, bug fixes, chores) destined for the main development branch (e.g., `develop` or `main`) MUST undergo a code review via Pull Requests (PRs) / Merge Requests (MRs) in our Git platform (GitHub implied by ADR-012).
*   **Number of Reviewers:**
    *   At least **one** other developer MUST review and approve a PR.
    *   For critical components or significant architectural changes, at least **two** reviewers are recommended, one of whom should ideally be a senior developer or tech lead.
*   **Review Checklist / Focus Areas:** Reviewers should focus on:
    *   **Correctness:** Does the code do what it's supposed to do? Does it handle edge cases?
    *   **Readability & Maintainability:** Is the code clear, concise, and well-documented (comments where necessary, clear naming)?
    *   **Adherence to Standards:** Does it follow API design guidelines (ADR-030), logging standards (ADR-010), security best practices (ADR-026), etc.?
    *   **Test Quality & Coverage:** Are there sufficient, well-written tests for the changes (ADR-013)?
    *   **Performance Considerations:** Are there any obvious performance implications?
    *   **No Introduction of Unnecessary Complexity or Technical Debt.**
*   **Constructive Feedback:** Reviews should be constructive and respectful. Focus on the code, not the author.
*   **Author Responsiveness:** Authors are expected to respond to review comments promptly and address concerns.
*   **Approval:** A PR can only be merged once all mandatory checks (CI pipeline including linting, formatting, tests, static analysis) pass and the required number of reviewers have approved the changes.
*   **No Self-Merging (Generally):** Authors should generally not merge their own PRs unless in specific, agreed-upon circumstances (e.g., trivial fixes with prior agreement, or in an emergency with post-merge review).

### 4. Tools and Integration
*   **CI/CD Pipeline (ADR-012):** All checks (formatting, linting, static analysis, test coverage) will be integrated as quality gates in the CI pipeline. A failed gate prevents merging or deployment.
*   **IDE Integration:** Encourage developers to integrate linters and formatters into their IDEs for immediate feedback.
*   **SonarQube / SonarCloud (Considered):** For more advanced static analysis, complexity tracking, and quality dashboards, consider integrating SonarQube (self-hosted) or SonarCloud (cloud-based) in the future. This is not a Day 1 requirement but a potential evolution.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   Significantly improves code quality, consistency, and maintainability.
    *   Reduces the likelihood of bugs and regressions.
    *   Facilitates better collaboration and knowledge transfer within the team.
    *   Helps in managing and controlling technical debt.
    *   Automated checks save time in reviews by catching common issues early.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Can initially slow down development velocity as teams adapt to stricter standards and review processes.
    *   Requires effort to configure and maintain static analysis tools and CI integrations.
    *   Code reviews can become bottlenecks if reviewers are unavailable or if there's contention.
    *   Setting appropriate thresholds for metrics like complexity or coverage can be challenging.
*   **Risks:**
    *   Standards being perceived as overly bureaucratic if not implemented thoughtfully.
    *   Inconsistent application of review standards if reviewers are not aligned.
    *   Over-reliance on tools without critical thinking during reviews.

## Next Steps

*   Configure Prettier and ESLint with agreed-upon rule sets in all service templates/starters.
*   Integrate formatter and linter checks into pre-commit hooks and the CI pipeline.
*   Set up initial test coverage reporting and define initial target percentages.
*   Formalize and document the code review process and checklist for PRs.
*   Provide training/workshops to the team on the new standards and tools.
*   Periodically review and adjust complexity thresholds and linting rules as the project evolves.

# ADR-021: Centralized Logging and Monitoring Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11
*   **Deciders:** Project Team
*   **Consulted:** DevOps/SRE Team, Lead Developers
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

In a distributed microservices architecture (ADR-001), understanding system behavior, diagnosing issues, and observing performance requires a robust centralized logging and monitoring strategy. This complements our Distributed Tracing strategy (ADR-017) by providing detailed logs from individual services and aggregated metrics for overall system health and performance.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Observability:** Gain comprehensive insight into the system's state and behavior.
*   **Troubleshooting & Debugging:** Efficiently identify and resolve issues in a distributed environment.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify bottlenecks.
*   **Alerting:** Proactively notify teams of critical issues or anomalies.
*   **Scalability:** The solution must handle a large volume of logs and metrics from numerous services.
*   **Ease of Use:** Developers and operators should be able to easily search logs and view dashboards.
*   **Integration:** Seamless integration with Kubernetes (ADR-006) and our CI/CD pipeline (ADR-012).

## Considered Options

1.  **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) / EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana):** Popular open-source solutions for log aggregation and visualization.
2.  **Prometheus and Grafana:** Open-source standards for metrics collection and dashboarding.
3.  **Cloud-Native Solutions (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Operations, Azure Monitor):** Managed services offered by cloud providers.
4.  **Commercial Observability Platforms (e.g., Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace):** Comprehensive SaaS solutions.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** A hybrid approach utilizing open-source standards, primarily the EFK Stack for logging and Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring, deployed on Kubernetes.

*   **Centralized Logging:**
    *   **Technology:** EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana).
        *   **Fluentd:** Will be used as the log collector/aggregator, running as a DaemonSet on Kubernetes nodes to collect container logs (stdout/stderr) and application logs from files if necessary.
        *   **Elasticsearch:** Will be the distributed search and analytics engine for storing and indexing logs.
        *   **Kibana:** Will provide the web interface for searching, visualizing, and dashboarding logs.
    *   **Structured Logging:** Services MUST emit logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON). Each log entry should include essential context like service name, version, timestamp, severity level, correlation ID (from distributed tracing - ADR-017), and relevant request/event data.
    *   **Log Retention:** Policies for log retention will be defined based on storage capacity and compliance requirements.

*   **Centralized Monitoring & Alerting:**
    *   **Technology:** Prometheus and Grafana.
        *   **Prometheus:** Will be used for collecting and storing time-series metrics from services. Services should expose a `/metrics` endpoint in a Prometheus-compatible format. Key metrics to expose include request rates, error rates, latencies (RED metrics), resource utilization (CPU, memory), and business-specific KPIs.
        *   **Alertmanager:** Integrated with Prometheus for defining and managing alerts based on metric thresholds or anomalies. Alerts will be routed to appropriate channels (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty, email).
        *   **Grafana:** Will be used for creating dashboards to visualize metrics from Prometheus and potentially logs from Elasticsearch (via plugins).
    *   **Service Instrumentation:** Services will be instrumented using client libraries (e.g., Prometheus client libraries, Micrometer for JVM-based services) to expose relevant metrics.
    *   **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Kubernetes cluster metrics (node status, pod health, resource usage) will also be scraped by Prometheus.

*   **Integration with Distributed Tracing (ADR-017):**
    *   Correlation IDs (Trace IDs, Span IDs) MUST be included in structured logs to allow easy correlation between logs, traces, and metrics.
    *   Kibana and Grafana should allow filtering and searching based on these correlation IDs.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   Provides comprehensive observability into the system.
    *   Open-source, widely adopted, and strong community support.
    *   Highly customizable and extensible.
    *   Well-suited for deployment on Kubernetes.
    *   Facilitates proactive issue detection and faster resolution.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires significant effort to set up, configure, and maintain the EFK stack and Prometheus/Grafana, especially at scale.
    *   Can consume substantial storage and compute resources.
    *   Steep learning curve for mastering the full capabilities of these tools.
*   **Risks:**
    *   Performance issues with Elasticsearch or Prometheus if not properly scaled or optimized.
    *   Loss of logs or metrics if the collection pipeline or storage backend fails.

## Next Steps

*   Deploy and configure Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana on the Kubernetes cluster.
*   Deploy and configure Prometheus and Grafana on the Kubernetes cluster.
*   Define standard structured logging formats and provide libraries/guidelines for developers.
*   Identify key metrics for each service and ensure they are instrumented.
*   Create initial dashboards in Grafana and Kibana.
*   Configure Alertmanager with initial alert rules and notification channels.
*   Establish log and metric retention policies.

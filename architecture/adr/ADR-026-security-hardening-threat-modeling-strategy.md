# ADR-026: Security Hardening and Threat Modeling Strategy

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Date:** 2025-05-11
*   **Deciders:** Project Team, Security Team
*   **Consulted:** Lead Developers, DevOps/SRE Team
*   **Informed:** All technical stakeholders

## Context and Problem Statement

While ADR-019 addresses Authentication and Authorization, a comprehensive security posture requires proactive measures for hardening our systems and regularly assessing potential threats. This ADR outlines strategies for ongoing security hardening of our microservices, infrastructure, and CI/CD pipeline, as well as the adoption of a systematic threat modeling process to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Proactive Vulnerability Management:** Identify and address security weaknesses before they can be exploited.
*   **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls.
*   **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC):** Integrate security practices throughout the development process.
*   **Compliance and Trust:** Meet regulatory requirements and build user trust by protecting data and system integrity.
*   **Risk Reduction:** Minimize the likelihood and impact of security incidents.
*   **Adaptability:** Ensure security measures can evolve with new threats and system changes.

## Considered Approaches

This ADR combines several established security best practices into a cohesive strategy.

1.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Periodic external assessments.
2.  **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) & Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Automated code and application scanning.
3.  **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Identifying vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
4.  **Infrastructure Security Best Practices:** Hardening OS, network, Kubernetes (ADR-006), and API Gateway (ADR-014).
5.  **Threat Modeling Methodologies (e.g., STRIDE, PASTA, VAST):** Structured approaches to identify threats.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Approach:** Implement a multi-faceted security strategy encompassing continuous hardening, automated security testing within the CI/CD pipeline (ADR-012), and regular threat modeling exercises.

*   **Application Security (DevSecOps):**
    *   **SAST/DAST/SCA:** Integrate SAST, DAST, and SCA tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code and dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Findings must be triaged and addressed based on severity.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Establish and enforce secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP Top 10, input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries).
    *   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update third-party libraries and frameworks. Use tools to monitor for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Strictly follow ADR-016 (Configuration Management) using Kubernetes Secrets and potentially HashiCorp Vault for sensitive data. No hardcoded secrets.
    *   **Input Validation:** All external input (API requests, user-submitted data) MUST be rigorously validated on the server-side.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Properly encode output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

*   **Infrastructure Hardening:**
    *   **Kubernetes Security (ADR-006):** Implement Kubernetes security best practices, including NetworkPolicies, PodSecurityPolicies (or their successors), RBAC, etcd encryption, and secure node configurations.
    *   **API Gateway Security (ADR-014):** Configure WAF (Web Application Firewall) capabilities, rate limiting, and DDoS protection at the API Gateway level.
    *   **Operating System Hardening:** Use minimal, hardened base images for containers. Regularly patch OS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Network Security:** Implement network segmentation (e.g., separate networks for different environments, DMZs). Restrict network access between services using Kubernetes NetworkPolicies.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure all components (users, services, applications) operate with the minimum necessary permissions.

*   **Threat Modeling:**
    *   **Methodology:** Adopt a standard threat modeling methodology (e.g., STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).
    *   **Frequency:** Conduct threat modeling for:
        *   New services or significant features before they are deployed.
        *   Existing critical services periodically (e.g., annually or after major architectural changes).
    *   **Process:** Involve developers, security personnel, and architects. Identify assets, trust boundaries, entry points, potential threats, and existing mitigations. Document identified threats and track mitigation actions.
    *   **Integration:** Findings from threat modeling should feedback into backlog grooming and security hardening efforts.

*   **Security Logging and Monitoring (ADR-021):**
    *   Ensure comprehensive security event logging (authentication attempts, authorization failures, suspicious activities).
    *   Configure alerts for security-critical events.

*   **Incident Response Plan:**
    *   Develop and maintain an incident response plan detailing steps to take in case of a security breach.

*   **Regular Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Schedule periodic (e.g., annual) external penetration tests and security audits for critical systems.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   Significantly improves the overall security posture of the platform.
    *   Proactive approach helps prevent breaches rather than just reacting to them.
    *   Integrates security into the development lifecycle, fostering a security-aware culture.
    *   Provides a structured way to identify and address potential threats.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires ongoing effort, resources, and expertise in security.
    *   Can add overhead to development and deployment processes if not managed efficiently.
    *   Automated tools can produce false positives, requiring manual triage.
    *   Threat modeling can be time-consuming.
*   **Risks:**
    *   Security is an ongoing process; new vulnerabilities and threats emerge constantly.
    *   Over-reliance on automated tools without manual oversight and expertise.
    *   Failure to act on identified threats or vulnerabilities.

## Next Steps

*   Select and integrate SAST, DAST, and SCA tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Develop and disseminate secure coding guidelines and provide training.
*   Establish a formal threat modeling process and schedule initial sessions for critical services.
*   Implement enhanced security logging and alerting as per ADR-021.
*   Begin drafting an initial incident response plan.
*   Plan for the first external penetration test.

# ADR-XXX: Future Off-AWS Migration Considerations

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Context:** The E-commerce platform is currently being developed with a strong reliance on AWS managed services to accelerate development, simplify operations, and leverage the AWS ecosystem. This approach is beneficial for the current project phase, focusing on learning and rapid iteration.
*   **Decision Drivers for this Document:** To proactively consider and document potential strategies for migrating key components to self-hosted or open-source alternatives if future business or technical requirements necessitate reduced AWS dependency, multi-cloud capabilities, or greater control over the infrastructure stack.

---

## 1. Abstract

This document outlines high-level considerations and potential alternative technologies for key architectural components currently implemented using AWS managed services. It serves as a strategic placeholder for a future scenario where the platform might be evolved or forked to operate with a reduced AWS footprint. The primary goal is to ensure that current architectural decisions, while AWS-centric, do not entirely preclude future flexibility.

This is not a plan for immediate action but rather a forward-looking exploration of alternatives.

## 2. Current AWS-Centric Approach

The current technology stack heavily utilizes AWS managed services for their operational benefits, scalability, and integration capabilities. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **API Gateway:** Amazon API Gateway
*   **Message Broker:** Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ
*   **Caching:** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis
*   **Database (Relational):** Amazon RDS (e.g., PostgreSQL)
*   **Database (NoSQL):** Amazon DynamoDB (if used)
*   **Identity Management:** Keycloak (self-hosted on EKS, but Cognito is an AWS option often considered)
*   **Service Mesh:** Istio (self-hosted on EKS, but AWS App Mesh is an AWS option)
*   **Monitoring & Observability:** Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, Amazon Managed Grafana, AWS X-Ray.
*   **Container Orchestration:** Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

## 3. Potential Migration Paths & Alternatives

Below are key areas and potential non-AWS alternatives:

### 3.1. API Gateway

*   **Current AWS Service:** Amazon API Gateway
*   **Potential Alternatives:**
    *   **Kong Gateway (Open Source/Enterprise):** Highly extensible, feature-rich, Kubernetes-native. Can be self-managed on EKS or any Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **Envoy Proxy-based solutions (e.g., Emissary-ingress, Contour):** Performant, flexible, widely adopted in cloud-native environments.
    *   **Apache APISIX:** High-performance, dynamic, cloud-native API gateway.
*   **Migration Considerations:**
    *   Replicating routing rules, authentication/authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT validation, API keys), rate limiting, and transformations.
    *   Operational overhead of managing the chosen gateway, its dependencies (like a database for Kong), and scaling.
    *   Integration with the existing IdP (Keycloak) and observability stack.

### 3.2. Message Broker (RabbitMQ)

*   **Current AWS Service:** Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ
*   **Potential Alternatives:**
    *   **Self-managed RabbitMQ on Kubernetes:** Using the RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator for deployment and management.
*   **Migration Considerations:**
    *   Data migration strategy for existing messages/queues (if applicable).
    *   Setting up clustering, high availability, and persistence.
    *   Replicating monitoring and alerting.
    *   Ensuring client applications can seamlessly switch connection endpoints.

### 3.3. Caching (Redis)

*   **Current AWS Service:** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis
*   **Potential Alternatives:**
    *   **Self-managed Redis Cluster on Kubernetes:** Using Helm charts or Redis Operator.
*   **Migration Considerations:**
    *   Data migration from ElastiCache.
    *   Configuring persistence, replication, and high availability.
    *   Network configuration to ensure low-latency access from application services.

### 3.4. Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)

*   **Current AWS Service:** Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
*   **Potential Alternatives:**
    *   **Self-managed PostgreSQL on Kubernetes:** Using operators like Patroni, Crunchy Data PostgreSQL Operator, or Zalando Postgres Operator.
    *   **Self-managed PostgreSQL on VMs.**
*   **Migration Considerations:**
    *   Complex data migration process, potentially involving downtime or a phased approach.
    *   Significant operational overhead for backups, patching, scaling, monitoring, and HA.
    *   Ensuring data security and compliance.

### 3.5. Identity Management (Keycloak - already self-managed)

*   **Current Approach:** Keycloak (self-managed on EKS).
*   **Considerations if moving EKS itself:** If the underlying Kubernetes platform (EKS) were to be moved off AWS, the Keycloak deployment would migrate with it. The primary consideration is ensuring its data persistence (PostgreSQL backend) is also migrated or accessible.
*   **If Cognito were used:** Migrating from Amazon Cognito would involve exporting user data and re-implementing authentication flows with a solution like Keycloak.

### 3.6. Service Mesh (Istio - already self-managed)

*   **Current Approach:** Istio (self-managed on EKS).
*   **Considerations if moving EKS itself:** Similar to Keycloak, an Istio deployment would migrate with the Kubernetes cluster. Configuration and integration points would need verification.

### 3.7. Monitoring & Observability Stack

*   **Current AWS Services:** CloudWatch, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, Amazon Managed Grafana, AWS X-Ray.
*   **Potential Alternatives (often used together):
    *   **Prometheus (self-managed):** For metrics collection.
    *   **Grafana (self-managed):** For visualization and dashboards.
    *   **Alertmanager (self-managed):** For alerting.
    *   **Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana - ELK/EFK) or Fluentd/Fluent Bit + OpenSearch/Elasticsearch:** For logging.
    *   **Jaeger or Zipkin (with OpenTelemetry):** For distributed tracing.
*   **Migration Considerations:**
    *   Setting up and managing the entire stack, including storage for metrics and logs.
    *   Instrumenting applications to send data to the new endpoints.
    *   Recreating dashboards and alert rules.
    *   Potential data loss during transition if not carefully planned.

### 3.8. Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)

*   **Current AWS Service:** Amazon EKS
*   **Potential Alternatives:**
    *   **Self-managed Kubernetes (e.g., kOps, Kubespray) on bare metal or VMs in another cloud/on-prem.**
    *   **Other managed Kubernetes services (GKE, AKS).**
*   **Migration Considerations:**
    *   This is a foundational shift. Requires re-provisioning the entire cluster infrastructure.
    *   Ensuring compatibility of workloads and Kubernetes manifests.
    *   Migrating persistent volumes and stateful applications.
    *   Re-configuring networking, load balancing, and ingress.
    *   Significant operational expertise required for self-managed Kubernetes.

## 4. Key Challenges for Off-AWS Migration

*   **Operational Overhead:** Self-managing infrastructure components significantly increases the operational burden on the team (provisioning, patching, scaling, monitoring, security, HA).
*   **Expertise:** Requires deep expertise in each of the chosen open-source technologies and their operational aspects.
*   **Cost:** While licensing costs might be lower for open-source, the total cost of ownership (TCO) including engineering time for management can be higher.
*   **Integration Complexity:** Integrating disparate open-source tools to achieve the same level of cohesiveness as AWS managed services can be challenging.
*   **Data Migration:** Moving data between systems (databases, message queues, caches) is often complex and carries risk.
*   **Security:** The team becomes fully responsible for securing all layers of the self-managed stack.

## 5. Conclusion

While the current project phase benefits greatly from using AWS managed services, having an awareness of potential open-source and self-managed alternatives is valuable for long-term strategic planning. Any future decision to move away from AWS would need to be driven by strong business or technical justifications and would require significant planning, resources, and expertise.

This document serves as an initial thought-starter for such scenarios.

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the e-commerce platform. These requirements define the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, scalability, security, and usability. They describe *how* the system should perform its functions.

## 2. Performance
### 2.1. Response Time
- Average page load time for key customer-facing pages (Homepage, Product Listing, Product Detail, Cart, Checkout) should be under **2 seconds** under normal load conditions (1000 concurrent users).
- API response times for critical services should be under **200ms** at the 95th percentile.
### 2.2. Load Handling
- The system should support **10,000** concurrent users without degradation in performance.
- The system should handle **100** orders per second during peak load (e.g., flash sale events).
### 2.3. Throughput
- The system should be able to process **500,000** product updates per day (e.g., price changes, stock updates).
- The system should support **600** payment transactions per minute.

## 3. Scalability
### 3.1. User Scalability
- The platform must be able to scale to support a **10x** increase in active users (from 10,000 to 100,000 concurrent users) over **2 years** without major architectural redesign.
### 3.2. Data Scalability
- The system must handle a growing catalog of **5 million** products and associated data (images, reviews).
- The system must handle increasing volumes of transactional data (orders, user activity) up to **50 million** orders per year.
### 3.3. Traffic Scalability
- The system must automatically scale resources (compute, storage, network) up or down based on traffic load (elasticity), especially during promotional events or seasonal peaks, aiming to scale up within **5-10 minutes** of sustained load increase.
### 3.4. Geographic Scalability
- The architecture should support deployment across multiple geographic regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) to serve a global user base and reduce latency to under **150ms** for users in those regions (if applicable).

## 4. Availability & Reliability
### 4.1. Uptime
- The platform should achieve an uptime of **99.95%** for critical services (equates to approx. 4.38 hours of downtime per year).
- Scheduled maintenance windows should be minimized (e.g., max 2 hours per month, outside peak business hours) and communicated at least **1 week** in advance.
### 4.2. Fault Tolerance
- The system should be resilient to failures of individual components or services. Failure of one service should not cascade and bring down the entire platform.
- Implement redundancy for critical components.
### 4.3. Disaster Recovery
- Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - e.g., **4 hours**.
- Define Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - e.g., **15 minutes**.
- Regular data backups must be performed (specify frequency and retention period).
- A documented disaster recovery plan must be in place and tested regularly (e.g., annually).

## 5. Security
### 5.1. Data Protection
- All sensitive user data (PII, payment information) must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) must be ensured.
### 5.2. Authentication & Authorization
- Strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) options for users and administrators.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for administrative functions.
### 5.3. Application Security
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
- Regular security audits and penetration testing.
### 5.4. API Security
- Secure APIs using industry best practices (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys).
- Input validation and rate limiting for APIs.
### 5.5. Compliance
- Adherence to relevant industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS for payment processing).
- Identify and comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements in target operational regions.

## 6. Usability
### 6.1. Customer Experience
- Intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface for customers on various devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
- Responsive design.
- Clear calls to action and feedback mechanisms.
### 6.2. Administrative Experience
- Efficient and user-friendly interface for administrators and operations staff.

## 7. Maintainability & Extensibility
### 7.1. Modularity
- The system should be composed of loosely coupled, independently deployable services (microservices architecture).
### 7.2. Code Quality
- Adherence to defined coding standards and best practices.
- Integration of static code analysis tools into the CI pipeline.
- Well-documented code (including API documentation).
- High test coverage (Unit, Integration, Contract tests - refer to ADR-013).
### 7.3. Ease of Updates & Deployment
- Automated CI/CD pipelines for frequent and reliable deployments.
- Support for blue/green deployments or canary releases to minimize downtime.
### 7.4. API Design
- Well-documented, versioned, and consistent APIs for internal and potentially external use.
### 7.5. Technology Stack
- Use of well-supported and modern technologies that allow for future evolution.

## 8. Data Consistency & Integrity
- Mechanisms to ensure data consistency across distributed services (e.g., eventual consistency, sagas).
- Data validation to maintain data integrity.

## 9. Observability
### 9.1. Monitoring
- Comprehensive monitoring of system health, performance metrics (including the "Four Golden Signals": Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation), and business KPIs.
- Real-time dashboards for visualizing key metrics.
- Proactive alerting for anomalies and threshold breaches.
### 9.2. Logging
- Centralized and structured logging for all services.
- Easy querying and analysis of logs.
### 9.3. Tracing
- Distributed tracing to track requests across multiple services for debugging and performance analysis.

## 10. Interoperability
- Seamless integration with third-party services (payment gateways, shipping providers, analytics, marketing tools).
- Standardized data formats (e.g., JSON, OpenAPI Specification) for integrations.

## 11. Accessibility
- The platform should be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG **2.1 Level AA** guidelines.

## 12. Cost Efficiency
- Optimize resource utilization to manage operational costs effectively.
- Leverage cloud-native services for cost savings where appropriate (e.g., serverless functions, auto-scaling, spot instances).

## 13. Configurability
- Key system behaviors and business rules should be configurable where appropriate (e.g., via configuration files, admin UI, feature flags) without requiring code changes and deployments.
- Support for environment-specific configurations.

## 14. Legal & Licensing
- Ensure compliance with the licenses of all third-party software, libraries, and components used.
- Maintain an inventory of software dependencies and their licenses.

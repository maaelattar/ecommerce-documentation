# E-commerce Documentation

This repository contains the comprehensive documentation for our cloud-native e-commerce platform, designed to support a scalable, resilient, and feature-rich online shopping experience.

## Overview

This documentation serves as the central knowledge base and architectural blueprint for our cloud-native e-commerce platform. It provides:

- A detailed system architecture overview
- Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key technical decisions
- API design guidelines and documentation strategies
- Security, reliability, and scalability considerations

The documentation is intended for software engineers, architects, product managers, and operations teams involved in building, maintaining, and evolving the platform.

## Usage

### Navigating the Documentation

- **Requirements**: Find functional and non-functional requirements in the `/requirements` directory
- **Architecture**: Explore system architecture overview and diagrams in the `/architecture` directory
- **ADRs**: Review architecture decisions in the `/architecture/adr` directory
- **Diagrams**: Visual representations of the system can be found in `/architecture/diagrams`

### Key Documents

1. **System Architecture Overview**: `/architecture/00-system-architecture-overview.md`
2. **Functional Requirements**: `/requirements/00-functional-requirements.md`
3. **Non-Functional Requirements**: `/requirements/01-non-functional-requirements.md`
4. **API Design Guidelines**: `/architecture/adr/ADR-030-api-design-guidelines.md`

## Development

# Tutorial 05: Payment Service Development

## üéØ Learning Objectives

In this comprehensive tutorial, you'll build a **production-ready Payment Service** that handles financial transactions with enterprise-grade security, PCI compliance considerations, and robust error handling. This is one of the most critical services in an e-commerce platform.

### What You'll Learn

- **Financial Transaction Management**: Processing payments, refunds, and maintaining financial integrity
- **PCI Compliance Patterns**: Implementing tokenization and security best practices for payment data
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Working with Stripe API in a secure, compliant manner
- **Enterprise Security**: Advanced authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Fraud Detection**: Basic fraud prevention and risk assessment patterns
- **Financial Reconciliation**: Audit trails and transaction tracking for compliance
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and transaction rollback patterns
- **Event-Driven Finance**: Publishing payment events with strong consistency guarantees

### Key Technologies & Patterns

- **Core**: NestJS with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, TypeORM
- **Security**: JWT authentication, role-based access, data encryption
- **Payments**: Stripe integration with tokenization
- **Events**: RabbitMQ with transactional outbox pattern
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry with financial transaction tracing
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for financial operations
- **Compliance**: PCI DSS considerations and data protection patterns

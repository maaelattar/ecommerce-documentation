# How to Think About Microservices: Architecture Decision Framework

> **Learning Goal**: Think like an architect when designing service boundaries and communication patterns

## 🤔 STEP 1: The Monolith vs Microservices Decision

### What Problem Are We Really Solving?

**Surface Problem**: "Our application is getting big"
**Real Problem**: "How do we manage complexity while maintaining development velocity and system reliability?"

### 💭 The Monolith Reality Check

**When Monoliths Work Well**:
- Small teams (< 10 developers)
- Simple business domain
- Tight coupling is actually beneficial
- Shared data models make sense
- Deployment simplicity is valued

**When Monoliths Become Painful**:
- Team coordination bottlenecks
- Technology lock-in
- Deployment becomes risky
- Scaling requirements differ by feature
- Independent release cycles needed

**❓ Stop and Think**: Are you solving complexity or creating it?

**💡 Key Insight**: Microservices trade development complexity for operational complexity.

## 🏗️ STEP 2: Service Boundary Thinking

### How Do You Cut a System Into Services?

**Wrong Approach**: Technical boundaries
- "Frontend service"
- "Database service" 
- "Authentication service"

**Right Approach**: Business domain boundaries (Domain-Driven Design)

### The Domain-Driven Design Method

```
1. Identify Business Capabilities
   ├── User Management
   ├── Product Catalog
   ├── Order Processing
   ├── Payment Processing
   ├── Inventory Management
   └── Customer Communication

2. Find Natural Boundaries (Where would Conway's Law put them?)
   ├── User Service ← User Management team
   ├── Product Service ← Catalog team  
   ├── Order Service ← Fulfillment team
   ├── Payment Service ← Finance team
   ├── Inventory Service ← Operations team
   └── Notification Service ← Customer Experience team
```

### 🛑 BOUNDARY TEST: The Team Ownership Question

**Ask**: "If this was a separate company, could they operate independently?"

**Example Analysis**:
- **User Service**: ✅ Could be a separate identity provider (like Auth0)
- **Payment Service**: ✅ Could be a separate payment processor (like Stripe)
- **Order + Inventory**: ❌ Too tightly coupled in business logic

**Mental Model**: Each service should be like a small startup within your company.

## 🔄 STEP 3: Communication Patterns Thinking

### How Should Services Talk to Each Other?

#### Pattern 1: Synchronous (HTTP/REST)
```
Service A --HTTP--> Service B --HTTP--> Service C
           <------          <------
```

**Mental Model**: Like a phone call - immediate response expected

**When to Use**:
- ✅ User-facing operations (need immediate feedback)
- ✅ Simple request-response patterns
- ✅ Strong consistency required

**Trade-offs**:
- 👍 Simple to understand and debug
- 👍 Immediate error feedback
- 👎 Tight coupling (if B is down, A fails)
- 👎 Cascading failures
- 👎 Latency accumulation

#### Pattern 2: Asynchronous (Events/Messaging)
```
Service A --Event--> Message Queue --Event--> Service B
                                  --Event--> Service C
```

**Mental Model**: Like sending letters - fire and forget

**When to Use**:
- ✅ Background processing
- ✅ One-to-many communication
- ✅ Eventual consistency acceptable

**Trade-offs**:
- 👍 Loose coupling (services can be down temporarily)
- 👍 Better scalability
- 👍 Natural retry and persistence
- 👎 More complex debugging
- 👎 Eventual consistency challenges
- 👎 Message ordering issues

### 🤔 Decision Framework: Sync vs Async

**Use Synchronous When**:
1. User is waiting for a response
2. You need data to continue processing
3. Strong consistency is required
4. Simple request-response fits the use case

**Use Asynchronous When**:
1. Background/batch processing
2. Notifying multiple services
3. Services have different availability requirements
4. You want to decouple service lifecycles

**❓ Real Scenario**: User places an order. Which parts are sync vs async?

**Think Through It**:
- Validate inventory → **Sync** (user needs immediate feedback)
- Process payment → **Sync** (user needs to know if it worked)
- Update inventory → **Sync** (part of order transaction)
- Send confirmation email → **Async** (user doesn't wait for this)
- Update analytics → **Async** (background process)

## 📊 STEP 4: Data Management Thinking

### The Database-Per-Service Pattern

**Traditional Approach**: Shared database
```
Service A ─┐
           ├─── Shared Database
Service B ─┘
```

**Microservices Approach**: Database per service
```
Service A ──── Database A
Service B ──── Database B
```

### 🤔 Why Separate Databases?

**Benefits**:
- Services can choose optimal storage (SQL vs NoSQL)
- Independent scaling
- No shared schema evolution pain
- Clear ownership boundaries

**Challenges**:
- No cross-service transactions
- Data consistency becomes complex
- Joins across services impossible
- Data duplication

### The Consistency Trade-off

**Strong Consistency** (Traditional):
```
BEGIN TRANSACTION
  UPDATE orders SET status = 'paid'
  INSERT INTO payments (order_id, amount)
  UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1
COMMIT
```

**Eventual Consistency** (Microservices):
```
1. Order Service: Create order (pending)
2. Payment Service: Process payment → Event: PaymentCompleted  
3. Order Service: Update order (paid) → Event: OrderConfirmed
4. Inventory Service: Reduce inventory → Event: InventoryUpdated
```

**💡 Mental Model**: Traditional = All-or-nothing. Microservices = Choreographed dance.

### 🛑 DATA DESIGN DECISION: What to Duplicate?

**Duplicate Freely**:
- User names (for display)
- Product names (for order history)
- Reference data (categories, statuses)

**Never Duplicate**:
- Passwords/secrets
- Financial balances
- Inventory quantities
- Any "single source of truth" data

**❓ Think**: Why is it OK to duplicate user names but not inventory quantities?

---

## 🚨 STEP 5: Failure and Resilience Thinking

### What Happens When Things Go Wrong?

In a monolith: If one part fails, everything fails.
In microservices: If one service fails, others should continue.

### The Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Mental Model**: Like electrical circuit breakers in your house

```typescript
// Pseudocode for circuit breaker thinking
if (serviceFailureRate > threshold) {
  return cachedResponse; // Fail fast, don't retry
} else {
  try {
    return callService();
  } catch (error) {
    recordFailure();
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**States**:
- **Closed**: Normal operation
- **Open**: Service is failing, don't call it
- **Half-Open**: Test if service is back up

### The Saga Pattern (Distributed Transactions)

**Problem**: How do you handle multi-service transactions?

**Traditional Transaction**:
```
BEGIN TRANSACTION
  Reserve inventory
  Charge payment  
  Create order
COMMIT (or ROLLBACK everything)
```

**Saga Pattern**:
```
1. Reserve inventory → Success
2. Charge payment → Success  
3. Create order → Success
✅ Happy path completed

OR

1. Reserve inventory → Success
2. Charge payment → FAILURE
3. Compensate: Release inventory reservation
❌ Saga rolled back
```

**💡 Key Insight**: Instead of preventing failure, plan for compensation.

## 🔍 STEP 6: Observability Thinking

### How Do You Debug a Distributed System?

**The Challenge**: 
- Request spans multiple services
- Logs are scattered across services
- Performance issues can be anywhere

### Distributed Tracing Mental Model

**Think of it like**: Following a package through shipping
```
Request ID: 123abc
├── User Service (20ms)
├── Product Service (150ms) ← Slow!
│   ├── Database query (120ms) ← Very slow!
│   └── Cache lookup (30ms)
└── Order Service (45ms)
```

**Three Pillars of Observability**:

1. **Logs**: What happened? (events)
2. **Metrics**: How much/how many? (numbers)
3. **Traces**: Where did time go? (flow)

### 🛑 OBSERVABILITY DESIGN: Correlation IDs

**Every request gets a unique ID that follows it through all services**

```typescript
// User Service
logger.info('User authenticated', { 
  correlationId: 'req-123abc',
  userId: '456def' 
});

// Product Service  
logger.info('Product fetched', { 
  correlationId: 'req-123abc',  // Same ID!
  productId: '789ghi' 
});
```

**Why This Matters**: When user reports "my order is slow", you can find all related logs instantly.

## 🎯 STEP 7: Putting It All Together - Design Exercise

### Scenario: E-commerce Checkout Flow

Let's design the checkout process using our thinking framework:

**Business Flow**:
1. User adds items to cart
2. User initiates checkout
3. System validates inventory
4. System processes payment
5. System creates order
6. System updates inventory
7. System sends confirmation

### 🤔 Apply Your Thinking:

**Service Boundaries** (Domain-Driven):
- **Cart Service**: Manages shopping carts
- **Inventory Service**: Tracks product availability  
- **Payment Service**: Handles payments
- **Order Service**: Manages orders
- **Notification Service**: Sends confirmations

**Communication Patterns**:
- Checkout validation → **Sync** (user waits)
- Payment processing → **Sync** (user needs result)
- Inventory update → **Sync** (part of transaction)
- Send email → **Async** (background task)

**Data Consistency Strategy**:
```
1. Validate inventory (sync)
2. Process payment (sync)
3. Create order with "processing" status (sync)
4. Publish OrderCreated event (async)
5. Inventory Service reduces stock → InventoryUpdated event
6. Order Service updates to "confirmed" → OrderConfirmed event
7. Notification Service sends email
```

**Failure Scenarios**:
- Payment fails → No order created, no inventory change
- Inventory update fails → Compensate by refunding payment
- Email fails → Retry with exponential backoff

### ❓ Self-Check Questions:

1. **Boundaries**: Could each service operate as a separate company?
2. **Communication**: Is the user waiting for this operation?
3. **Consistency**: What happens if this step fails?
4. **Observability**: How would you debug a slow checkout?

## 💡 Key Mental Models You've Learned

### 1. **Conway's Law in Practice**
"Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure"
- Align service boundaries with team boundaries
- Each team owns their service's entire lifecycle

### 2. **CAP Theorem Trade-offs**
You can't have Consistency, Availability, AND Partition tolerance
- Microservices typically choose Availability + Partition tolerance
- Accept eventual consistency for better resilience

### 3. **The Distributed Systems Tax**
Every benefit comes with a cost:
- Independent scaling → More operational complexity
- Fault isolation → More failure modes
- Technology diversity → More expertise needed

### 4. **Orchestration vs Choreography**
- **Orchestration**: Central coordinator (like a conductor)
- **Choreography**: Services react to events (like a dance)
- Choreography is more resilient but harder to understand

## 🤔 STEP 1: Understanding Data Beyond Tables

### What Problem Are We Really Solving?

**Surface Problem**: "We need to store data"
**Real Problem**: "How do we organize information to support current needs while enabling future growth?"

### 💭 Think Beyond CRUD

Most developers think:
```
Data → Table → CRUD operations → Done
```

Senior engineers think:
```
Business Domain → Access Patterns → Consistency Requirements → 
Performance Needs → Technology Choice → Schema Design
```

**❓ Stop and Think**: What questions should you ask before creating any table?

**Critical Questions**:
1. **How will this data be queried?** (Read patterns)
2. **How often will it change?** (Write patterns)
3. **How consistent must it be?** (Consistency requirements)
4. **How fast must queries be?** (Performance requirements)
5. **How much will this grow?** (Scale requirements)

**💡 Key Insight**: Data modeling is predicting the future needs of your application.

## 🏗️ STEP 2: SQL vs NoSQL Decision Framework

### The Mental Model: Different Tools for Different Jobs

**SQL Databases**: Like a well-organized filing cabinet
- Structured, predictable
- ACID guarantees
- Complex relationships
- Strong consistency

**NoSQL Databases**: Like flexible storage units
- Schema flexibility
- Horizontal scaling
- Eventual consistency
- Specialized use cases

### 🤔 When to Choose SQL

**Choose SQL When**:
- ✅ **Complex relationships** between entities
- ✅ **ACID transactions** are required
- ✅ **Consistent data structure** across records
- ✅ **Complex queries** with joins needed
- ✅ **Team expertise** with SQL

**Example Scenarios**:
```
✅ E-commerce orders (relationships between users, products, payments)
✅ Financial transactions (ACID critical)
✅ HR systems (structured employee data)
✅ Inventory management (consistent schemas)
```

### 🤔 When to Choose NoSQL

**Document Stores (MongoDB, CouchDB)**:
- ✅ **Varying document structures**
- ✅ **Rapid development** and schema evolution
- ✅ **JSON-like data** from APIs

```
✅ Content management (blog posts, articles)
✅ Product catalogs (different product types)
✅ User profiles (varying fields per user type)
```

**Key-Value Stores (Redis, DynamoDB)**:
- ✅ **Simple lookups** by key
- ✅ **High performance** requirements
- ✅ **Caching** scenarios

```
✅ Session storage
✅ Shopping carts
✅ Real-time leaderboards
```

**Graph Databases (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)**:
- ✅ **Complex relationships** are the main query pattern
- ✅ **Traversal queries** (find connections)

```
✅ Social networks (friend relationships)
✅ Recommendation engines
✅ Fraud detection (transaction patterns)
```

**Time Series (InfluxDB, TimeDB)**:
- ✅ **Time-stamped data** 
- ✅ **Analytics and monitoring**

```
✅ IoT sensor data
✅ Application metrics
✅ Financial market data
```

### 🛑 DECISION FRAMEWORK: The Data Decision Tree

```
1. Do you need ACID transactions across multiple entities?
   └── YES: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
   └── NO: Continue...

2. Are relationships the primary query pattern?
   └── YES: Graph DB (Neo4j)
   └── NO: Continue...

3. Is this primarily time-series data?
   └── YES: Time Series DB (InfluxDB)
   └── NO: Continue...

4. Do you need complex queries with aggregations?
   └── YES: SQL or Document DB with strong query support
   └── NO: Continue...

5. Is this simple key-value lookups?
   └── YES: Key-Value store (Redis, DynamoDB)
   └── NO: Document DB (MongoDB)
```

## 🔄 STEP 3: Microservices Data Patterns

### The Database-Per-Service Pattern

**Traditional Monolith**:
```
User Service ─┐
              ├─── Shared Database
Order Service ─┘
```

**Microservices Approach**:
```
User Service ──── User Database
Order Service ──── Order Database
```

### 🤔 Why Separate Databases?

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Independent scaling** (order data grows faster than user data)
- ✅ **Technology choice** (users in PostgreSQL, orders in DynamoDB)
- ✅ **Deployment independence** (schema changes don't affect other services)
- ✅ **Clear ownership** (user team owns user data completely)

**Challenges**:
- ❌ **No cross-service transactions**
- ❌ **Data consistency complexity**
- ❌ **Joins across services impossible**
- ❌ **Data duplication required**

### Data Consistency Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Saga Pattern (Choreography)
```
Order Service: Create order (status: pending)
↓ (OrderCreated event)
Payment Service: Process payment
↓ (PaymentProcessed event)  
Order Service: Update order (status: paid)
↓ (OrderConfirmed event)
Inventory Service: Reduce stock
```

**Mental Model**: Like a dance - each service reacts to events from others.

#### Strategy 2: Saga Pattern (Orchestration)
```
Order Orchestrator:
1. Call Inventory Service (reserve items)
2. Call Payment Service (charge customer)
3. Call Order Service (confirm order)
4. If any fail → compensate previous steps
```

**Mental Model**: Like a conductor - central coordinator manages the flow.

#### Strategy 3: Event Sourcing
```
Instead of storing current state, store all events:
1. OrderCreated
2. PaymentProcessed  
3. ItemsShipped
4. OrderCompleted

Current state = replay all events
```

### 🛑 DATA DUPLICATION DECISION: What to Duplicate?

**Duplicate Freely**:
- **Reference data**: User names, product names for display
- **Denormalized views**: Order summaries, user dashboards
- **Cached data**: Frequently accessed but slowly changing

**Never Duplicate**:
- **Source of truth**: Inventory quantities, account balances
- **Secrets**: Passwords, API keys, payment tokens
- **Real-time data**: Current prices, live inventory

**Example: Order Service Data Model**
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  customerId: string;
  customerEmail: string;    // ✅ Duplicated for notifications
  customerName: string;     // ✅ Duplicated for display
  
  items: Array<{
    productId: string;
    productName: string;    // ✅ Duplicated for order history
    priceAtOrder: number;   // ✅ Snapshot of price when ordered
    quantity: number;
  }>;
  
  totalAmount: number;      // ✅ Calculated and stored
  status: OrderStatus;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**❓ Why duplicate customer email and product names?**
- Email: Need for notifications without calling User Service
- Product names: Order history should show what was actually ordered, even if product name changes later

## 📊 STEP 4: Schema Design Thinking

### Normalization vs Denormalization Trade-offs

#### Normalized Design (Traditional)
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Orders table  
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Order items table
CREATE TABLE order_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),
  product_id UUID,
  quantity INTEGER,
  price_per_item DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No data duplication
- ✅ Easy to update (single place)
- ✅ Referential integrity

**Costs**:
- ❌ Joins required for most queries
- ❌ Complex queries for simple displays
- ❌ Performance issues as data grows

#### Denormalized Design (NoSQL/Performance)
```typescript
// Order document (MongoDB/DynamoDB style)
{
  id: "order-123",
  customer: {
    id: "user-456",
    email: "user@example.com",
    name: "John Doe"
  },
  items: [
    {
      productId: "prod-789",
      productName: "MacBook Pro",
      quantity: 1,
      pricePerItem: 1999.00
    }
  ],
  totalAmount: 1999.00,
  status: "shipped",
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Single query for complete order
- ✅ Fast reads (no joins)
- ✅ Natural JSON structure

**Costs**:
- ❌ Data duplication
- ❌ Updates are complex (multiple places)
- ❌ Potential inconsistency

### 🤔 Hybrid Approach: Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

**Mental Model**: Different models for reading vs writing

```
Write Side (Normalized):
Users Table ← Create/Update operations
Orders Table
Order Items Table

Read Side (Denormalized):  
Order View Documents ← Query operations
User Dashboard Views
Analytics Views
```

**How it works**:
1. **Commands** (writes) go to normalized database
2. **Events** are published on changes
3. **Read models** are updated from events
4. **Queries** read from denormalized views

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Optimal structure for both reads and writes
- ✅ Can use different databases for each side
- ✅ Read models optimized for specific queries

---

## 🔍 STEP 5: Performance Thinking

### Understanding Access Patterns

**Before designing schema, understand**:
1. **Read/Write ratio** (90% reads vs 50/50?)
2. **Query patterns** (by ID, by date range, by status?)
3. **Data size** (thousands vs millions of records?)
4. **Growth rate** (stable vs exponential?)

### Indexing Strategy

**Mental Model**: Indexes are like book indexes - fast lookup but slow to maintain

```sql
-- Without index
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 'user-123';
-- Scans all records: O(n)

-- With index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
-- Direct lookup: O(log n)
```

**Index Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Faster queries** on indexed columns
- ❌ **Slower writes** (must update index)
- ❌ **Storage overhead** (index takes space)

**Golden Rule**: Index your query patterns, not your data patterns.

### 🛑 PERFORMANCE PATTERNS

#### Pattern 1: Read Replicas
```
Application ──Write──► Primary Database
     │                       │
     └──Read──► Read Replica ──┘
```

**When to use**: High read load, can tolerate slight lag

#### Pattern 2: Caching Layer
```
Application ──► Cache (Redis) ──► Database
               (if miss)
```

**When to use**: Expensive queries, mostly read data

#### Pattern 3: Sharding
```
Users 1-1000 ──► Shard 1
Users 1001-2000 ──► Shard 2  
Users 2001-3000 ──► Shard 3
```

**When to use**: Single database can't handle load

## 🧪 STEP 6: Consistency Models Thinking

### ACID vs BASE Trade-offs

#### ACID (Traditional SQL)
- **Atomicity**: All or nothing
- **Consistency**: Valid state transitions
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere  
- **Durability**: Committed data persists

**Mental Model**: Like a bank transaction - either the transfer happens completely or not at all.

#### BASE (NoSQL/Distributed)
- **Basically Available**: System remains operational
- **Soft state**: State may change without input (eventual consistency)
- **Eventually consistent**: System becomes consistent over time

**Mental Model**: Like Wikipedia - multiple editors may conflict temporarily, but it eventually becomes consistent.

### 🤔 Consistency Decision Framework

**Choose Strong Consistency (ACID) When**:
- ✅ **Financial transactions** (money can't be lost)
- ✅ **Inventory reservations** (can't oversell)
- ✅ **User authentication** (security critical)

**Choose Eventual Consistency (BASE) When**:
- ✅ **Social media feeds** (slight delay OK)
- ✅ **Analytics data** (aggregations can be approximate)
- ✅ **Content recommendations** (suggestions can be stale)

### Real-World Example: E-commerce Consistency

```typescript
// Strong consistency needed
interface InventoryReservation {
  productId: string;
  quantityReserved: number;
  orderId: string;
  // Must be ACID - can't oversell
}

// Eventual consistency acceptable  
interface UserRecommendations {
  userId: string;
  recommendedProducts: string[];
  lastUpdated: Date;
  // Can be stale - user won't notice
}
```

## 📈 STEP 7: Data Migration and Evolution

### Schema Evolution Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Backwards Compatible Changes
```sql
-- ✅ Safe changes
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);  -- Add optional column
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);    -- Add index

-- ❌ Breaking changes  
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN email;             -- Remove column
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN name TYPE TEXT;   -- Change type
```

#### Strategy 2: Versioned APIs with Data Transformation
```typescript
// API v1 response
interface UserV1 {
  id: string;
  fullName: string;  // Single field
}

// API v2 response (new schema)
interface UserV2 {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;  // Split into two fields
  lastName: string;
}

// Transform for backwards compatibility
function transformUserV1(userV2: UserV2): UserV1 {
  return {
    id: userV2.id,
    fullName: `${userV2.firstName} ${userV2.lastName}`
  };
}
```

#### Strategy 3: Event Sourcing Migration
```typescript
// Old event format
interface UserRegisteredV1 {
  version: 1;
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  fullName: string;
}

// New event format
interface UserRegisteredV2 {
  version: 2;
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

// Handle both versions
function handleUserRegistered(event: UserRegisteredV1 | UserRegisteredV2) {
  if (event.version === 1) {
    const [firstName, lastName] = event.fullName.split(' ');
    return { ...event, firstName, lastName };
  }
  return event;
}
```
